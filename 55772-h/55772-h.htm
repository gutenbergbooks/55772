<h1>THE PEDDLER SPY.</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">BOSTON “DICKERS” WITH THE DUTCHMEN.</span></h2>

<p>Down the Connecticut, not many miles from the city of
Hartford, in the early days of the State of Wooden Nutmegs,
stood an ancient fort, known by the name of “The House of
Good Hope.” By reference to that veracious chronicle known
as “Knickerbocker’s History of New York,” you will find
that it was built by the good people of New Netherlands, to
prevent further encroachment on the part of a race which has
since taken the generic name of Yankee. Although the history
mentioned may be correct, it might be open to censure
on the ground that the writer was biased in favor of his own
people. Be that as it may, the people of Good Hope had
planted themselves upon the river, determined to keep back,
as far as possible, the domineering race which had intruded
upon the happy valley.</p>

<p>Although honest Diedrich may have been somewhat angry
at our ancestors, the Puritans, still we are forced to say that
they were not very far wrong in their estimate of character.
The stolid Dutchmen were poorly suited to contend with them
in an encounter in which wit was the weapon used. Placed
face to face, each with a stout oak cudgel in his hand, perhaps
no Dutchman would have feared to meet one of the hated race.
But when it came to the commodity in which they did not
deal, namely, cunning, the Puritans had the advantage.</p>

<p>The New Netherlanders claimed all the land extending
from the banks of the Hudson to the Connecticut; and certainly,
if any white man could claim the soil at all, their claim
was prior to that of the English. But, with the wholesome
proviso that “might makes right,” the Puritans pushed their
settlements to the side of the Happy River, under the very
nose of the Dutch commandant at Good Hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>What that worthy thought, when the first members of the
hardy band, who pushed their way through the trackless wilderness
to this spot, made their appearance, is not fully set
down. We only know, by the history before mentioned, that
they became obnoxious to the Dutch from their desire to teach
the damsels the absurd custom of “bundling,” in which no
true Dutchman would indulge. Besides, they had begun, even
at this early period, to show that sharpness in making bargains
which since has distinguished them above other nations in the
world. Certain of them made a practice of “swapping
horses” with the men of Good Hope; and, although the
beasts they brought for “dicker” were, to all appearance, good
ones, yet no sooner was the bargain completed than the horses
begun to show traits which had not been “set down in the
bill.” Indeed, it begun to be proverbial that horse-trading
with the Windsor people meant a transaction in which a
Dutchman gave a very good beast and some <em>gelt</em> for a very
poor one and no <em>gelt</em> at all. Moreover, the English were addicted
to the practice of overreaching the spouses of absent
Hans and Yawcop with transactions for small articles, such
as constitute a peddler’s pack in our day. Some will go so
far as to say that, under the mask of perfect disinterestedness
of purpose, these Yankees would almost break up housekeeping
on the part of a couple possessed of considerable means,
in a single visit—so much were they ahead of the tramps of
the present day. Indeed, it is averred that the main cause of
hostility on the part of the Dutchmen against the English was
the fact of the influence of these profane wanderers over the
partners of their phlegmatic joys and stolid sorrows.</p>

<p>But, be that as it may, the inhabitants of Hartford were not
in very good order with those of Good Hope. On whose side
the blame lay, we will leave to historians to decide—if they
can—while we proceed with our narrative.</p>

<p>Good Hope was an awkward structure of mud and logs,
such as the Dutch built in that day; strong enough, however,
for the purpose for which it was built, if it had been in different
hands. It faced upon the river, was armed with some
of the clumsy ordnance common to the period, and was garrisoned
by about forty men from the settlement at New York,
who were somewhat overfed, and inclined to smoke all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
time they were not eating or drinking. Their leader, Van
Curter, was one of those fiery, self-willed men sometimes
found in his nation, who mistake pig-headed obstinacy for firmness
of heart. An old soldier, trained under the unhappy
Prince of Orange, he thought no people like his own, and no
soldier like himself. He had seen, with ill-disguised jealousy,
that a people were growing up about him who were ahead of
his own in acuteness, and who were daily outstripping them
in matters of business. He had written a dispatch to Wouter
Von Twiller, Governor of New Netherlands, acquainting
him with the inroad of these Windsor people, and of the absolute
incapacity of his men to compete with them. The
governor thereupon issued a proclamation, commanding the
English to withdraw from land which was the property of the
Dutch East India Company.</p>

<p>The Yankees’ answer was very much to the same effect as
that of the worthy Master Nicholas, when he defied the trumpeter
of William Kieft, applying his thumb to the tip of his
nose, and spreading out the fingers like a fan. At least, they
paid no attention to the proclamation, but continued to take
up land, and increase the limits of their colony. The only
reply they did vouchsafe to the demand of the governor was
that they claimed the land in the right of possession, and
would not give it up. The New Netherlanders had no desire
to make a quarrel with their neighbors, who were, for the
most part, strong men, who would not hesitate to use manual
<em>persuasion</em> in case it became necessary. Hence the Dutchmen
resorted to all manner of threats, entreaties—any thing but
violence.</p>

<p>There was one person, in particular, who was a source of
constant annoyance to the people of Good Hope. This was
a hawker of small trinkets, known in the settlements as Boston
Bainbridge. A sharp, business-like fellow, not a bad prototype
of the Down-Easter of our day, he made his way into
every house from Boston to the City of Brotherly Love. His
pack was welcomed in the houses of his own countrymen,
who, being as sharp in buying as he was in selling, seldom allowed
him to get the better of them. But the Dutchmen
were not so cunning, and were overreached in many a bargain.
Boston did not confine himself entirely to dealing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
small wares, but sold many articles of greater value; bought
and sold horses, or, as he expressed himself, was a “mighty
man on a dicker.”</p>

<p>Boston came into Good Hope on a bright morning in the
early part of the month of June. His pack had been replenished
in Hartford, and he hoped to diminish its contents
among the Dutch. He was a middle-sized, active-looking
man, about forty years of age, clad in a suit of gray homespun.
His pack was, as usual strapped upon his back, while
he led a forlorn-looking Narragansett pony, which paced
slowly along behind its master, like a captive led to the stake.
Boston had some misgivings that certain things sold to these
people must have come to grief since his last visit. But this
was not by any means the first time he had been tackled by
them for selling bad wares, and he never was at a loss for an
answer.</p>

<p>The families of the Dutch had built up a little village about
the fort, and he entered boldly. The first man he met was an
unmistakable Teuton, with a broad, bulky figure, built after
the manner of Wouter Von Twiller, then Governor of New
Netherlands. This individual at once rushed upon the Yankee,
exhibiting the blade of a knife, severed from the handle.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha, Yankee! You see dat, eh? You sell dat knife
to me; you sheat me mit dat knife.”</p>

<p>“You git eout,” replied the Yankee. “I never sold you
<em>that</em> knife!”</p>

<p>“Yaw! Dat ish von lie; dat ish von <em>pig</em> lie! You vas
sell dat knife mit me.”</p>

<p>Boston lowered the pack from his shoulder and took the
despised blade in his hand.</p>

<p>“Now then, Dutchy, what’s the matter with this knife, I
should like to know?”</p>

<p>“Donner unt blitzen! Das ish von big sheat knife. Goot
for nix. Das knife not coot preat, py Shoseph!”</p>

<p>“How did you break it?” asked the peddler, fitting the
pieces of the knife together and taking a wire from his pocket.
“This is a good knife, I reckon. You broke the rivet. Now
look at me, and see how far we are in advance of you in the
arts and sciences. I tell you, Hans Drinker, you don’t know
any thing about these matters—blamed if you do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke, he took out a pair of pincers, riveted the blade
in, pounded it, and held up the knife for inspection.</p>

<p>“Look at that, neow, Hans Drinker. Any one but a Dutchman
would have done that long ago, instead of waiting for a
poor fellow who sold you the knife at a <em>sacrifice</em>.”</p>

<p>“Vat ish dat, eh? I no care for dat? I says de knife
vill not cut preat,” cried Hans.</p>

<p>“See here—where have you had this knife? You put it
in hot water, I know. Tell the truth and shame the adversary—didn’t
you, now?”</p>

<p>“Vell, I did; but dat no hurt.”</p>

<p>“All you know. Of <em>course</em> it hurts! What do you expect
a knife to be that you can buy for a shilling, English money?
It took the temper out of it, I allow.”</p>

<p>“Vat ish demper?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind. That knife is spoiled, and I know how.
I wouldn’t give an English penny for it to-day. For why? A
Dutchman don’t know how to use a knife. Consequence—he
spoils it.”</p>

<p>Hans paused in some doubt, seeing the blame of the failure
of the knife laid so fully upon his guiltless shoulders. Boston
gave him no time to think, but threw open his pack.</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll tell you what I mean to do. You don’t deserve
it; but I will do a violence to my conscience, and do something
for you. Keep your fingers to yourself and feast your
eyes upon that.” Here he produced a knife somewhat better
than the one which Hans had returned. “Now, I’ll tell you
what I will do. ’Tisn’t right, I know it; ’tisn’t behaving properly
to those who bought the last lot I had, but you may have
<em>that</em> knife for four shillings sterling. You stare. I don’t
wonder, for that knife ought to bring fully <em>ten</em> shillings. It’s
worth it, if it’s worth a farthing; but what can I do? I
must put my goods down to you fellows or you won’t look at
them. I am making myself a poor man for your sakes.”</p>

<p>“Vour shilling. Dat ish too mooch, by Shoseph!”</p>

<p>“Too much! I tell you I am <em>giving</em> the knife away—absolutely
<em>giving</em> it away. That knife you bought before was a
<em>cheap</em> knife, I allow that; but it was <em>sold</em> cheap; but I lose on
this knife if I sell it at six shillings, and here I offer it to you
at four. Many a time I am tempted to shut up my pack and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
tramp through the woods no more; but when I think that it
will be impossible for you to get along without me, I repent,
and sacrifice my own interests for your good. I can’t help it,
if I am soft-hearted, it’s one of my little failings. I sell below
cost because I hate to be hard upon poor men.”</p>

<p>Hans took the knife in his hands and begun to open and
shut the bright blade. He had been beaten again and again
by this same peddler, and did not care to be taken in once
more. The polished blade shone like glass in the sunlight.</p>

<p>“Dat ish goot knife, eh?”</p>

<p>“Good! You’d better believe it’s good. Why, I know a
man down to Hartford has got one of them there knives, and
what do you reckon he does with it? You can’t tell, scarcely.
No, ’tain’t probable you can. Then <em>I’ll</em> tell you. He uses it for
an <em>ax</em>, and he can cut down a good-sized maple with it about as
soon as you cut a cat-tail down with one of your clumsy axes.
I don’t say that <em>this</em> is as good a knife as <em>that</em>. Probably
’tain’t; but it came out of the same mold.”</p>

<p>“Big price, dat. Sure dis is goot knife, eh? You sell me
bad knife two, t’ree, vour dimes. Dat ish pad—dat is worser
as pad. Vour shillings?”</p>

<p>“Four. But see here. I ain’t given you inducement
to buy, it seems. Rot me ef I don’t think you are about the
toughest tree I ever tried to climb. Now look at me, and see
a man always ready to sacrifice himself for the good of the
people. Here are a pair of combs. They are worth
money—they are <em>good</em> combs. I throw them into the pile,
and what else? Here is a good pair of shoe-buckles. I
throw them in, and beg you to take the pile away for six
shillings. You won’t? I thought so. You ain’t capable of
it, more’s the pity. I’ll again hurt my own feelings by saying
five-and-six. If you don’t take them at that I must shut
up my pack. Hans Drinker, you were born to good luck.
I don’t think, upon my word and honor, that any one
ever had such a chance since the days of Noah. I don’t,
sart’inly.”</p>

<p>“You talk so fast dat I has nottings to zay mitout
speaking. Vell, I takes dem. Py Shoseph, if tey ish not
goot, I kills you mit a mistake, shure!”</p>

<p>“I’ve half a mind to take it back. I think—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nix, splitzen, nean; I puys dem goots. Dey ish mine.
Vive-unt-sax; dere it ish.”</p>

<p>“Well, take them,” said Boston, with a sigh of resignation.
“I lose by you, but I gave you my word, and you may have
them.”</p>

<p>Having thus effected a sale of the articles, which were dear
at eighteen pence, Boston lifted his pack and proceeded
blithely on his way, while Hans Drinker hurried away to display
his treasures, and chuckle over his bargain. Boston was
not fated to proceed far, when he was arrested by a yell from
a house by the roadside.</p>

<p>“Holt on, dere! you sleutzen Yankee, holt on!”</p>

<p>“He-he,” chuckled Boston, “That’s old Swedlepipe. Now
<em>he</em> will give me rats about that horse.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the person who had stopped him threw open
the door of his cottage, and rushed out into the road. He
was a stout-built old man, very red in the face, and flourishing
a staff over his head.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” cried Boston. “Is it possible that I see my
dear friend Mynheer Swedlepipe? Give me your hand, mynheer.
This is, indeed, a sight for sore eyes.”</p>

<p>“It vill be a sight for sore heads, pefore you go, or else my
name is not Paul Swedlepipe. Vat you do, you Yankee rascal?
You comes to Good Hope mid your flimpsy goots, unt
sell dem to honest Dootchmen. I vill preak every pone in
your skin.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mynheer Swedlepipe, my dear mynheer, what
<em>have</em> I done? Just tell me what I have done? Shake
hands.”</p>

<p>“You dry to shake hands mit me unt I preak your head.
Vat you done to your tear Mynheer Swedlepipe, eh? Vell,
den, I dells you. You prings to dish place von old hoss dat
ish not vorth <em>von</em> guilder. Hein, you curry him unt you
comb him, unt you make him look ver’ nice. I dinks it ish
von ver’ goot horse, unt I pays you von hunder guilders!
<em>Sturm unt wetter!</em> Ish dat nottings, eh? <em>Hagel!</em> I kills
you deat ash von schmoke-herring.”</p>

<p>The stick flourished about in dangerous proximity to Boston’s
ears, who sat upon his pack with an immovable countenance,
watching every motion on the part of the other with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
his sharp eyes. There was something in his face which deterred
the Dutchman from striking.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the horse, mynheer, I should like
to know?”</p>

<p>“Matter! Dere ish not von disease vich a horse can have
dat he hash not.”</p>

<p>“Let me know one.”</p>

<p>“He hash de <em>heaves</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And de <em>ring-bone</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And he ish bone-spavined.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And he sprained-shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Donner! Ton’t sit dere unt say yes, yes, yes! S’all I
dell you one more t’ing? Vell, here it ish. He has nix toot’
in his head!”</p>

<p>“No?” cried Boston, in surprise. “He had when I brought
him here. How did he lose them?”</p>

<p>“Dey shoost dropped out in his manger te first times I feed
him. Ton’t lie to me. You put his teet’ in to sell him. You
tied dem in mit strings, you pig, <em>pig</em> rogue!”</p>

<p>“Gracious, mynheer! Is it possible that you consider me
capable of such business?”</p>

<p>“Yaw!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do? Now you are wrong. I bought that horse
of a friend in Hartford. He is not the man I took him for,
nor the horse is not what you took him for. Well, who is
to blame? I take it, that it is the man who sold me the horse
first. I didn’t think he’d a-done it, mynheer; I didn’t think
he’d a-done it.”</p>

<p>Mynheer looked at him in a species of indignant admiration.
He had thought that the peddler would not certainly
have the surpassing effrontery to deny the fact of his knowledge
of the various diseases by which the poor animal was
afflicted.</p>

<p>“You means to dell me, den, dat you don’t know dat dis
horse ish <em>plind</em>?”</p>

<p>“Is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yaw; he ish plind ash a pat. He ish teaf. You not
knows dat, either?”</p>

<p>“That explains it! Now, I fired off a gun close to his ear,
one day, and he didn’t even jump. That was because he was
deaf. Well <em>now</em>!”</p>

<p>“Dere ish one t’ing more. You didn’t know dat de nice
tail he carried pelonged to some nodder horse?”</p>

<p>“You don’t say! Not his own tail? If I ain’t beat!
Well, mynheer, the rascal has beat us both this time. He has
got the money, and we can’t help ourselves. I didn’t tell you
that I gave a hundred and ten guilders for the beast, did I?
No? Well, you see by that I lost on the trade with you. I
always lose, most years.”</p>

<p>Swedlepipe shook his head, and dropped his stick dejectedly.
He would have understood the pleasant little fiction on the
part of Boston if he had known that a farmer near Hartford
had lost a horse by drowning. Boston had taken possession
of his tail and teeth, and by the aid of the two had so contrived
to patch up an ancient steed which he picked up in the
woods, where it had been turned out to die, as to sell him to
poor Swedlepipe at an exorbitant rate.</p>

<p>Old Swedlepipe scratched his head. He had sworn by the
name of his patron saint, worthy Nicholas, that he would give
Boston Bainbridge a taste of wholesome Dutch cudgel, if he
ever dared to set foot in Good Hope again. And yet here he
was, and had purged himself of all stain, by saddling the
guilt upon some unfortunate third person.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, squire,” said he, “I’m sorry for this. If I
had only <em>known</em> that the horse was a bad one, I would have
brought you another from Windsor. Oh, you better believe
they have horses <em>there</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yaw, dey must have dem <em>dere</em>, for dey never prings dem
<em>here</em>.”</p>

<p>“Ha,” said the other. “There are some sharp people
down to Windsor. There’s Holmes, now. You know Holmes?
He is the man who wouldn’t stop when you threatened to
blow his sloop out of water. Of course they don’t send away
their best horses often. Sometimes they do. You see this
pony? If I had known that you would want a horse you
might have had him. You know Ten Eyck?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yaw. Pig rascal he is!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Just so. Wal, that hoss is for him.”</p>

<p>“For Ten Eyck?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t a very pig hoss.”</p>

<p>“No, ’tain’t. But it’s the best hoss of its kind in the country.
He ain’t very fast, to be sure. But, for all that, if he
ran a race against a red deer, I should know which to put
my money on. That’s the same hoss, mynheer, that went
from Providence to Salem in jist tew days. You don’t believe
it? Wal, I don’t ask it of you. Don’t take <em>my</em> word for it.
I don’t say that the hoss has got a good eye. ’Twouldn’t do
me any good; you wouldn’t believe me. Look for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Did Ten Eyck send for dat hoss?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” replied Boston, in high dudgeon.
“’Tain’t no use for you to ask. You can’t have this hoss.”</p>

<p>“Not if I gif’s you money?”</p>

<p>“Hey?”</p>

<p>“Not if I gif’s you more money as Ten Eyck?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“How much he gif’s?”</p>

<p>“Fifty guilders.”</p>

<p>“Hein!”</p>

<p>“Fifty guilders.”</p>

<p>“Der tuyvel!”</p>

<p>“But what’s the use talking? I must go on and leave the
hoss. Want any thing in my line, mynheer?”</p>

<p>“Holt on. Ten Eyck shan’t hav’ dat hoss. I gif’s you
sixty guilders for him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’d break my word for ten guilders?” cried
Boston, taking up his pack.</p>

<p>“Seventy.”</p>

<p>“Say eighty.”</p>

<p>“No; seventy.”</p>

<p>“Seventy-five. Come, git up, Lightfoot!”</p>

<p>“Vell, I gif’s it. I gets de money.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll stay here. By the way, where is that
other hoss?”</p>

<p>“Turned him out to commons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll give you five guilders for him.”</p>

<p>“Dake him. He not wort two kreutzers.”</p>

<p>“Not to <em>you</em>,” replied the Yankee; “but to me he may be
of use. Git the money.”</p>

<p>Swedlepipe plunged into the cabin, and reappeared a moment
after, and counted the money into Boston’s hand.</p>

<p>“Any thing else I can do for you, mynheer?”</p>

<p>“Yaw.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Vell, I dells you. Shoost you sheat Ten Eyck so bad ash
you sheat me, unt I gif’s you <em>den</em> guilders!”</p>

<p>“Is that a bargain, squire?”</p>

<p>“Yaw! He vound out dat you selt me dat hoss, unt he
laughs von whole day. Now, you sheat him. Vill you do
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll cheat him for the ten guilders, for your sake.
You know I don’t often do it; but, to please a good friend, I
will do a violence to my conscience, particularly in a case like
this.”</p>

<p>“Ven will you do it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; pretty soon. When I have done it,
you shall hear from me. I shall want that old hoss, howsumdever.”</p>

<p>“Send for him ven you wants him. How you sheat Ten
Eyck, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know now. I’ll tell you when I do it.”</p>

<p>He took up his pack and trudged courageously down the
little street toward the fort. The stolid sentry made some
demur against his entrance; but he got through at last.
Swedlepipe gazed after him, with open mouth, until his form
was concealed from view. Then, slowly replacing the pipe
between his teeth, he ejaculated: “Dat ish ter tuyvel’s poy, I
dinks.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">BOSTON ON THE WITNESS-STAND.</span></h2>

<p>Boston Bainbridge knew that he entered the fort at considerable
peril to himself; but he had learned, in his wandering
life, to look danger in the face. His trickery in trade was
as natural to him as the rising of smoke. But, underlying his
whimsical manner, there was a vein of pure bravery, and an
inherent love for deeds of daring. The jealousies between
the Yankees and Dutch had strengthened by degrees, until the
two parties begun to concert plans to oust each other from the
stronghold they had taken. The Windsor party was headed
by Captain William Holmes, a man of great individual courage,
who had refused to retrace his steps when he first ascended
the river, and ran by under fire of the Dutch guns. Knowing
that the Dutch were concerting some plan for his overthrow,
he determined to send Boston Bainbridge to Good
Hope with his pack, to see what he could pick up in the way
of information.</p>

<p>The appearance of Boston was no sooner made known to
Van Curter, the commandant, than he sent out his orderly to
bring the hawker into his presence. The former was a tall,
hook-nosed man, with the erect bearing of a soldier. Boston
did not like the expression of his eye. It was full of fire,
dark and penetrating.</p>

<p>“Your name is Boston Bainbridge,” said he. “If I remember
aright, you were here some four months ago?”</p>

<p>“You are right, squire. I <em>was</em> here then, and I calculate I
did a heap of dicker.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you did? Allow me to remind you of the fact that
you were told not to come here any more. You did not pay
much attention to that.”</p>

<p>“Now, see here, squire, I’ll tell you all about it. I’m a
trader, and it stands to reason that when a feller gets a good
place to sell, he don’t like to leave it. I didn’t think you
more than half-meant it. Let me show you some goods I’ve
got—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Silence!” thundered Van Curter.</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Silence, I say. Listen to me. Who sent you here?”</p>

<p>“Who sent me here? Now, squire, I calculate that ain’t a
fair question. Who should send me here? I came here to
sell goods. Let me show—”</p>

<p>“Hans!” cried Van Curter.</p>

<p>The orderly entered.</p>

<p>“Draw your sword,” continued Van Curter, “and if this fellow
attempts again to speak of his beggarly pack, run him
through the body.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the hawker begun to flash, and he folded his
arms upon his breast.</p>

<p>“Your questions?” he cried. “Let me hear them.”</p>

<p>“First, then, who sent you here?”</p>

<p>“I have told you already.”</p>

<p>“What did you come to do?”</p>

<p>“You will make nothing out of me while a man stands
over me with a drawn sword. I am only a poor man—one
of the poorest in his majesty’s colony—but the threats of no
<em>Dutchman</em> under heaven can scare <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“What would you have me do?”</p>

<p>“Send away this fellow with the sword, and let me talk in
my own way. We shall get along quite as well. And don’t
try to bully. I ain’t used to it. There are those who will see
me righted if I am ill-treated—<em>that</em> you must know.”</p>

<p>“Do you threaten?”</p>

<p>“Will you send this fellow away?”</p>

<p>“Retire, Hans, and stand at the door. Enter when I
call.”</p>

<p>The orderly obeyed.</p>

<p>“Now speak,” said Van Curter.</p>

<p>“You see, squire, I had been to Boston, and I calculated it
was about time you were out of nicknacks, so I came out.”</p>

<p>“You stick to that story? Have you been to Windsor?”</p>

<p>“Wal, I calculate I have.”</p>

<p>“What is Holmes doing?”</p>

<p>“That’s rather a hard question. The last time I saw him,
he was eatin’. He <em>has</em> got a mouth to put away the provisions
in, now I tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pish, man; you know what I want to know. Tell me
what they are doing at Windsor.”</p>

<p>“They are building a mighty big stock-house there, I reckon—nigh
as big as Good Hope. But law, what <em>can</em> they do? You
could eat them up!”</p>

<p>“Are they preparing to attack me?”</p>

<p>“No, I calculate not. They have all they kin do to keep
the Indians friendly.”</p>

<p>“Do they talk much about us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, more or less. Not any thing to count, howsumdever.”</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> do they say?”</p>

<p>“I reckon they think you are pretty strong here. They
talk about that some.”</p>

<p>“Do you think, if they were to attempt it, they would drive
us out of Good Hope?”</p>

<p>“Now, I don’t know as to <em>that</em>. I am a bit of a Boston
man myself, and don’t care so much for Windsor. I don’t say
they wouldn’t if they got the chance. You see, it’s a pretty
bit of land, and you asked them to come out here.”</p>

<p>“So we did, fools that we were to do it. What would you
advise us to do?”</p>

<p>“You want me to tell you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Honest?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then <em>this</em> is what I think: Don’t stir us up. We are
good folks, if you let us alone; but if you rile us up, we git
hornety. I don’t say this to scare you, or any thing. But we
are tough colts to ride without a halter.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we fear you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t say it. You may or you may not. But, you ask
my advice, and I give it. Don’t cut up rough. Don’t go to
smoothing us against the grain. Go with the nap of the
cloth, and you’ll find it’ll work better.”</p>

<p>“Ah! How many men have you at Windsor?”</p>

<p>“Don’t keep mixing me up with the Windsor folks, squire.
I don’t belong there. I am a Boston man, myself.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t refuse to tell me how many men you
have?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would if I could. A good many had gone out to hunt
and trade. All through, there was a pretty lively sprinkling
of them, I calculate.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they have as many as we have?”</p>

<p>“How many do you reckon?”</p>

<p>Van Curter instantly gave him this information, and immediately
cursed himself for doing it, fearing that the hawker
would take advantage of the fact against him. He was the
more angry from the fact that Boston refused to be at all explicit
in regard to the number at Windsor. “He hadn’t
counted,” he said. “They were scattered round a good deal;
might be more or might be less. Couldn’t bring himself to
say, to a certainty, whether they had as many as Van Curter
or not, but most probable a likely number.”</p>

<p>“How did you come here?”</p>

<p>“I reckon that is easy to answer. Part of the way I
walked, and part of the way I rode. Couldn’t I sell you
something, squire?”</p>

<p>“Wait until I have finished my questions. Did you see
Captain Holmes at Windsor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I told you before.”</p>

<p>“Was William Barlow in Windsor?”</p>

<p>“The lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Y-a-a-s. He was there.”</p>

<p>“Did he know you were coming here?”</p>

<p>“Guess so.”</p>

<p>“Do you <em>know</em>?”</p>

<p>“Y-a-a-s, I think he did. I didn’t make no secret of it. I
trade here a great deal.”</p>

<p>“The last time you were here, you brought a message to
my daughter from him. Don’t deny it, for I know you did.
Have you one now?”</p>

<p>“No. The lieutenant found out that you were mad about
it, and he thought he wouldn’t trouble the gal just now.”</p>

<p>“You are sure you have not a letter about you somewhere?”</p>

<p>“You may s’arch me, if you think I have. ’Twon’t be the
first time it’s been done.”</p>

<p>“You are willing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t say I am just <em>willing</em>. I allus prefer to have the
handling of my goods <em>myself</em>. Before you call in your men,
I’ll go over the box and show you that there ain’t any message
in that.”</p>

<p>Van Curter looked on zealously as the hawker tumbled
over his goods upon the floor, and turned over its contents.
He then examined the pack itself, and found nothing. Boston
put the things back, saying, that “Dutchmen had sometimes
light fingers as well as heavy bodies.”</p>

<p>Van Curter now called in two men, who searched the
hawker with great care. They found nothing.</p>

<p>“I told you so before you begun,” said he. “You wouldn’t
believe <em>me</em>. Perhaps you will next time, and save yourself
trouble.”</p>

<p>The fellows went out, and Van Curter begun again, with
the air of a man without hope:</p>

<p>“Did you come here alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. What will you ask next? I’d like to have
you get done as soon as you can, for I want to be at work.
I’m losing money on you.”</p>

<p>A light came into the face of the other. “You like money,
then?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t much ahead of any Dutchman of my acquaintance,
then. They like money. Of course I like money. Why
not?”</p>

<p>“Then I have not been holding out the right inducement
for you to speak.”</p>

<p>“You are right in your head, old lad. I don’t speak without
a proper inducement.”</p>

<p>“Is this right?” asked Van Curter, slipping a couple of
gold pieces into his hand.</p>

<p>“Double it,” said the other, shortly. The commandant
obeyed. Boston clinked the pieces upon the floor, tried them
with his teeth, and, being satisfied that they were good, put
them in his pouch and turned to the commandant.</p>

<p>“That <em>is</em> the right argument. What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Did Barlow send any message to my daughter?”</p>

<p>“Y-a-a-s, he did.”</p>

<p>“Have you got it?”</p>

<p>“Not in writin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“Assured her that he was hers till death.”</p>

<p>“Ha!”</p>

<p>“That his love would never grow cold.”</p>

<p>“The insufferable Englishman!”</p>

<p>“That he had not yet given up hope.”</p>

<p>“He had better.”</p>

<p>“Hopes to win your good will.”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“Bids her trust in him, and they will meet again.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The commandant mused for some moments, with his head
bowed upon his hand. Van Curter was one of those obstinate
men, found often among soldiers, who loved or hated
with vindictive energy. His hatred of the Yankees was intense,
and it offended him greatly that his daughter should
fix her affections upon one of the despised race. It would
have pleased him better to have seen her married to some fat
burgher of New Netherlands—one of his own nation.</p>

<p>“Listen, sir,” said he, at last. “I have a few words to say
to you. I love my child as well as any man can do. But I
would sooner see her dead at my feet than married to a Yankee.”</p>

<p>“Now, see here, squire. Don’t talk that way. ’Tain’t
proper. We are an odd kind of people; I calculate we always
get even with any one who hurts us. You don’t know the
lieutenant very well, I see. I do. There ain’t a finer boy
from the Floridas to Penobscot. He is brave, of good family,
and I really don’t see what you have against him.”</p>

<p>“Let that pass. I have told you what I think about this
matter. He shall never again see Theresa Van Curter.”</p>

<p>Boston hummed a low tune.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe any such thing, squire. You can’t
keep two young people apart. If I want to hurry on a marriage,
I always get some old maid, old woman, or old man,
no matter which, to <em>oppose</em> the match. <em>That</em> will bring it on,
as sure as a gun!”</p>

<p>“You think so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“It stands to reason. It’s just the way of human nature.
They always want to eat forbidden fruit. Your best way
would be to laugh the girl out of the idea, if you are so set
against it.”</p>

<p>“What a nation you will make some day,” cried the other,
in a tone of admiration. “You can not fail. There is nothing
which you can not compass, for your desires are boundless.
I seem to see with a prophet’s eye. This great continent
will one day bear a great nation famous for its liberal
ideas, a nation of cunning men, who will hold the world in
their grasp. My nation will contribute to make up <em>this</em>
nation; for where liberal ideas and freedom to mankind hold
sway, the Dutch must have a hand.”</p>

<p>Worthy Van Curter, sitting in his rude fort upon the banks
of the bright river, and prophesying the future of the land, in
his wildest dreams never approached the reality. Who could
hope that, in less than ten generations, the power of the wonderful
race should have built up a republic, the grandest of
nations, the hope of all the world!</p>

<p>“But, this is idle talk,” the soldier continued, rising from
his seat. “When you go back to Windsor, and you must go
soon, as I will not have you hanging about here, you will see
this Lieutenant Barlow, and take this message from me:
under no circumstances will I tolerate, in the least degree, his
addresses to my daughter. Let him beware how he crosses
my path, or worse will come of it. Will you remember?”</p>

<p>“Y-a-a-s, squire.”</p>

<p>“You may now go out and sell your goods. I give you
two days. After that, you must leave the settlement.” He
rose and left the room, not aware of the fact that Boston was
snapping his fingers behind his official back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">TWO DUTCH BEAUTIES.</span></h2>

<p>“Git eout,” said Boston, executing another flourish as he
disappeared. “Two days, umph. Where will you be in two
days, I should like to know? Now to business.”</p>

<p>He took up the pack and departed from head-quarters, going
out upon the parade. There he was besieged by a score of
Dutchmen, several of whom reproached him with bad faith in
previous bargains, but did not fail to buy; indeed, Boston
Bainbridge was gifted by nature with that shrewdness in a bargain
which is characteristic of that famous town from whence
he took his name; so gifted, indeed, that one of his own
countrymen, who had been cheated by him, gave him the
name, and it had stuck to him ever after.</p>

<p>Getting rid of his purchasers, he carried his diminished
pack to the door of a house more pretentious than the others,
situated upon the river bank. His knock brought to the
door a Teutonic damsel, who started back in undisguised dismay
at the sight of the hawker.</p>

<p>“Hist, Katrine,” said he; “don’t make a row. How are
you?”</p>

<p>“What do you want, Boston?” replied the girl, quickly.
“I will not join any scheme against the peace of my cousin.”</p>

<p>“Sho, now, who asked you? It seems to me, my dear,
that you don’t seem glad to see me, after so long a time.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t. Don’t you know it’s dangerous to come here?
You were in trouble enough before, cheat that you are; but
now—”</p>

<p>“Well, what now?”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell. It’s enough for you to know that something
besides a broken head will be yours if you stay. Take up
your pack, for heaven’s sake, and be off about your business.”</p>

<p>Boston passed his arm about the waist of the buxom girl,
and led her into the kitchen. There he dropped his pack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
drew her down upon his knee, and kissed her with hearty
good-will. She struggled desperately, uttered a good many
protests, and ended by returning his kisses in right good earnest.</p>

<p>“Dere now,” said Katrine, in her pretty English, just
enough touched with the Teutonic element to give it a zest,
“I hope you be satisfied. Now tell me why you come here?
Be quiet, can’t you?”</p>

<p>The last exclamation was elicited by an attempt on the
part of Boston to kiss her again. This she resisted, as in
duty bound, until out of breath, and then yielded as before.</p>

<p>“You want to know why I am here. I came upon that
which you would have sent me away on a while ago—business,
and to see you.”</p>

<p>“Me! Far enough from Good Hope you would be, if only
poor Katrine brought you here. Confess, now, you have
other business?”</p>

<p>“Of course; I said so. <em>Plenty</em> of business, and you must
help me, Katrine. But first, tell me what you meant by saying
I should have something besides my head broken?”</p>

<p>“Just your neck, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t much, Katrine.”</p>

<p>“No, dat ain’t much, or you wouldn’t risk it so many times
every day. I tell you to go away.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me why.”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell, either.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t go. I am not going to run away from a
shadow.”</p>

<p>“Dis no shadow; you will be taken as a spy.”</p>

<p>“Sho; we ain’t at war with the Dutch. No saying how
soon we may be, though; besides, I don’t mind telling you
that I have been before the commandant to-day, and was pretty
thoroughly searched, too. What does it matter? They didn’t
find any thing, though. Where is your cousin?”</p>

<p>“I knew you would come to that, Boston; but it is no
use. I won’t—I <em>won’t</em>—I <span class="smcapuc">WON’T</span>! You needn’t ask me.”</p>

<p>“You won’t—you <em>won’t</em>—you <span class="smcapuc">WON’T</span>! and I needn’t ask
you. That’s pretty strong. Pray, before you refuse any thing,
wait till you are asked. Do you think I want to hurt your
cousin?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” sobbed poor Katrine, “I don’t think you
would; but I love my cousin.”</p>

<p>“So do I!”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“I love her just as every man who ever saw her loves her,
as I love a beautiful picture or a clear night, or as something
holy and pure, entirely beyond my reach. As a lovely piece
of God’s handiwork, I admire her—but she would not do for
every-day use. I have some one in my mind who would suit
me better.”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Katrine, quickly.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to tell; you might not like it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said she, struggling away from him. “Don’t
touch me again; I don’t want to know her name.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you must hear it,” replied the other, “I’ll tell it
now, just to spite you. Her name is—”</p>

<p>“I won’t hear,” cried the girl, putting her fingers in her
ears—“I won’t hear. Don’t you try for to tell me.”</p>

<p>“She is a pretty girl, I tell you,” said Boston, with a malicious
twinkle in his eyes, “and you don’t know how I love
her—you don’t want to hear her name?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Katrine, with a quiver of the lip, “I won’t
hear it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind not to tell you, though I know you are
dying to hear it. Yes, I will; her name is—” Katrine took
her fingers partly out of her ears.</p>

<p>“A Dutch one,” went on Bainbridge. The girl again stopped
her ears.</p>

<p>“But a pretty name for all that,” said Boston. “You
don’t want to hear it; then I’ll tell it. I call her <em>Katrine</em>!”</p>

<p>“What’s her other name?”</p>

<p>“Veeder.”</p>

<p>“<em>Me!</em> Oh, you beast—you been fooling me all dis time.
You lie, <em>dreadful</em>; I don’t know what may happen to you; but,
after all, I am glad you said Katrine, and I am glad you said
Veeder, for I don’t know what I should do if you were to fall
in love with any one else, you dear, cheating, bundling old
vagabond!”</p>

<p>With these somewhat contradictory epithets, Katrine kissed
him, then and there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s get back to what we were talking of before, my
dear,” said Boston. “I can’t afford too much time here. Where
is Theresa?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere about the house.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Boston; promise me—promise poor Katrine
that you will not lead her into any rash things, which may
make her father angry; he is none too kind to her since she
saw dat young lieutenant, and they learned to love each
other. Dat’s de same time you and me tried it, you dear old
swindler.”</p>

<p>“The very time. Now, I ain’t going to make no rash
promises. I don’t know what <em>may</em> happen; but, this I will
promise—through my means, no harm shall come to the gal.
I like her for herself, and I like her for the sake of Willie, who
is the best young fellow I know.”</p>

<p>A clear, rich voice sounded at this moment in a merry song.
Katrine held up her hand.</p>

<p>“That’s her; who could have the heart to do her a wrong?
Ah; she is coming in here.”</p>

<p>The door was thrown open, and the singer stood upon the
threshold like a picture in a frame—a beautiful picture, too.
Theresa Van Curter was a rare type of her style of beauty—the
blonde. Her fair hair, lustrous and waving, was put back
from a white forehead, and confined at the back with an antique
comb; her dress was suited to the station in which she
was placed, partaking something of the Indian character, and
giving free play to her limbs, a broad hat, which she had been
wearing in her stroll through the forest, was swung upon her
arm, while her hand clasped a bouquet of wild flowers she
had gathered. She started in some surprise at the appearance
of Boston, and then, dropping the flowers and hat to the floor,
sprung forward.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, you here! Have you any news?”</p>

<p>She paused in some confusion.</p>

<p>“You needn’t go on,” said Boston, “I never keep a lady
waiting. I have a letter for you.”</p>

<p>Theresa put out her hand quickly.</p>

<p>“It must be from <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s from <em>him</em>. Your father tried hard to find it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
He would give me both Jerusalem and Jericho if he knew
I had it. You see I calculated on being searched, and hid
the paper.”</p>

<p>“You did?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. Have you got such a thing as a knife around
here? Thank you, Katrine. What a famous little house-keeper
you’ll make, having every thing so handy about you! Take
hold of my old cap and help me.”</p>

<p>A few moments’ work about the lining of the old hat which
the hawker had worn revealed a letter, which he took and
handed to Theresa. She turned away to the window, and
read it hastily. A shade passed over her fine face as she read.</p>

<p>“Is he well?” she asked, turning to Boston, who was engaged
in a flirtation with Katrine.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, ma’am. You see he is out of spirits on your account,
and that runs him down some. But he is hearty.
Just send him a cheery word, and all will be well in the
twinkling of an eye.”</p>

<p>“I am going to my room now, and shall write an answer
to this. You must remain until I come back. I shall not be
long.”</p>

<p>She hurried away quickly, leaving Boston with Katrine—and
they sat down by the casement. They quarreled, and
“made up” again, several times, before Theresa appeared with
an answer to the note.</p>

<p>“I have a little to say to you. Your father took me to-day,
and made me confess that I had a message to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear! You did not show him that letter?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. But I told him that the message was
verbal, and gave him one of my own making up. Sounded
natural enough. Faithful unto death, and that sort of stuff.
You understand.”</p>

<p>“And did not Willie send any such message to me?”</p>

<p>“A thousand; but I couldn’t think of half he said, if I
were to spend a week in meditation on the subject. You
will take them all for granted.”</p>

<p>“I fancy that Willie had better change his messenger,” said
Theresa, with a pout. “I am sure he might do better.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say that <em>I</em> think you are wrong,” replied
Boston, coolly stroking his beard. “There ain’t another man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in the five provinces that would do for you what I’ve done,
time and again.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I said that, Boston,” said Theresa, relenting
quickly. “I know you are faithful and true, but you ought to
remember. Was my father <em>very</em> angry?”</p>

<p>“Very particularly angry,” replied Boston. “Looked as
if he wanted to eat all the tribe of Yankees, beginning with
me.”</p>

<p>“Was he angry at me?”</p>

<p>“I calculate he <em>was</em>. I don’t want no one to be angrier
with me, I guess. He was <em>awful</em> mad.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better go away. But first open your pack
and let me get what I need. We have waited a long time for
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you can trust me. You know that, though
I will beat Dutch <em>men</em> sometimes, I never try to beat women.”</p>

<p>“What a twister,” cried Katrine.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you put in at all, Katrine. I won’t have it.
Let me trade with Miss Theresa in my own way. You know
I won’t try to cheat her.”</p>

<p>“But you do some women.”</p>

<p>“In trade I might. You stop talking, or the dress I am
going to sell you will fall to pieces in washing.”</p>

<p>The girl was bending over the pack when the commandant
entered. He looked a little angry when he saw the peddler.</p>

<p>“Don’t attempt to ply your trade here, sir. Go elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Why, squire, as to that, the way I look at it is this: You
gave me two days to trade, and you didn’t say <em>where</em> I should
go in particular. You didn’t buy any thing, and I thought
your daughter might want a few traps.”</p>

<p>“Where do you intend to pass the night?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But surely some one will be glad to entertain
me, and take some of my wares in consideration. I’ve
picked up a good many furs since I came out here, and they
are getting heavy. I can’t travel far in a day.”</p>

<p>“You should have a horse,” said Theresa, looking up from
the pack, which she was turning over after a woman’s fashion.</p>

<p>“I <em>did</em> have one when I came, but old Paul Swedlepipe
wouldn’t take ‘no’ for an answer, but would have him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager my commission that he paid for the horse,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
said Van Curter, with a laugh. “How much did he give
you?”</p>

<p>“Seventy-five guilders. I look upon it in the light of a
praiseworthy action—<em>giving</em> that hoss away.”</p>

<p>“Giving it away! S’death, man, I have a dozen horses,
and you may have the best of them for seventy-five guilders.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a look into your stable before I go away,” said
Boston. “In the mean time, I’ve got something I want
<em>you</em> to look at.” He tumbled over the wares and took out a
pair of heavy spurs. “Now look at that,” he cried, in a tone
of exultant admiration. “Did you ever, in your born days,
see sech a pair of spurs as that? No you didn’t, so you needn’t
say it. I don’t say that they are the best pair of spurs in the
Colonies, but I put it to you, squire, can you put your finger
upon a pair as good, anywhere? If you can, I should be
proud to know it.”</p>

<p>Van Curter took up the spurs and looked at them closely.</p>

<p>“Now tell me,” said he, “where is the cheat in this pair of
spurs. I take it for granted that there is such a thing about
it, since a Yankee brought them. Is it in the price, or in
the articles themselves?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that,” replied Boston, with an air of injured
innocence, “I don’t say any thing. You will have it that
there is a cheat in every thing I offer for sale; but, if there
is one there, <em>you</em> can’t find it.”</p>

<p>Van Curter laughed again.</p>

<p>“Come now,” he said, “I am willing to take the spurs, and
at your price, too, if you will tell me just where the cheat is
to be?”</p>

<p>“You will take them any way?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you; or, rather, it won’t be necessary to tell
you any more than the price.”</p>

<p>“And what is the price?”</p>

<p>“Forty guilders.”</p>

<p>“Hein!” shouted Van Curter, breaking into Dutch. “Do
you mean, seriously and gravely, to ask me forty guilders for
a pair of spurs not worth ten?”</p>

<p>“You wanted to know where the cheat was—in the spurs
or the price. You’ve got it. It’s in the <em>price</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Der tuyvel! Hold; here is your money. And now
take away your pack, or you will ruin my house. Go quickly.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking to wait,” said Boston, coolly buttoning
up the cash in his breeches-pocket, “until the lady has made
her selections; she don’t seem to have finished.”</p>

<p>“Make your purchases quickly, Theresa, and come with
me. I wish to speak with you. Do not delay.”</p>

<p>Theresa gathered up her purchases and demanded the price.
He gave such a moderate one, even for him, that Van Curter
was astonished, and made no attempt to make the price less.</p>

<p>“You have some conscience yet, Bainbridge,” he said.
“Here is your money. Come, Theresa.”</p>

<p>The girl followed him from the room, casting a glance
back at the peddler, who had stooped over his pack, and was
throwing out various articles, at the bidding of Katrine.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I will bring from Boston when I
come again?” said he.</p>

<p>“No,” said Katrine, with a smile. “What?”</p>

<p>“A ring and a minister.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Katrine, in sublime unconsciousness.</p>

<p>“If you don’t know now you will know then,” was the
answer. “You’d better have this dress made up against that
time.” With this he kissed her again, arranged his pack,
and left the house, making his way back to the house of
Paul Swedlepipe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">BOSTON “SHEATS” THE LEAN DUTCHMAN, AND TURNS UP
IN HIS REAL CHARACTER.</span></h2>

<p>Boston found Paul Swedlepipe exercising the horse which
he had so lately bought from him. Beyond a strong desire
to get his hind feet higher than his head when hard
pressed, and a tendency to roll upon his rider when spurred,
Paul had no fault to find with his purchase. He found that
the little beast really possessed great powers of endurance,
and was tolerably swift. The truth of the matter was, Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
had purchased the pony for his own use, and not to <em>sell</em>.
The pleasant little fiction on his part, in regard to his having
been purchased for Mynheer Ten Eyck, was made up on the
spur of the moment, to induce Swedlepipe to buy, for Boston
never missed any opportunity for a trade.</p>

<p>Not being cheated so badly as he expected, Swedlepipe
was in good humor, and received the peddler with a smile,
even while he restrained an attempt to kick on the part of
the Narragansett.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha! Boston. Dat you, eh? Dis pretty goot hoss;
glad dat you not sheat me too mooch dis time. You come
for dem guilders, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, mynheer. You see I’ve been pesky busy sense
I left you. But I’ll keep my word. There comes Ten Eyck
now.”</p>

<p>“Yaw, dat is goot. Let me stant by vile you sheat
him.”</p>

<p>“I am only going to begin to-day. To-morrow I will
finish,” replied Boston.</p>

<p>The ancestor of that famous race, the Ten Eyck’s of our
country, rode up at this moment. It may be well to mention
that this man and Swedlepipe were hereditary foes, and lost
no opportunity for inflicting loss upon each other. Ten Eyck
had rather the best of the encounter, as he had heard the
story of the horse sold to Swedlepipe a few months before,
which had caused the quarrel between the peddler and
Swedlepipe.</p>

<p>In person, the two Dutchmen were at variance. Swedlepipe
was short and stout; Ten Eyck was tall and lank.
Swedlepipe’s hair was black; Ten Eyck’s was yellow, nearly
approaching to red. Swedlepipe’s voice was pitched in a high
treble; Ten Eyck had a deep, resounding bass. In an encounter
with cudgels, the battle would have been to the
strong, in the person of Swedlepipe. The acute Ten Eyck
knew this right well, and likewise knew that he had the advantage
in the use of harsh words and taunts. He had been
especially hard upon poor Paul in the matter of the horse-trade.</p>

<p>The steed which Ten Eyck himself bestrode would not
have been selected as an object of admiration upon Broadway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
or Rotten Row. In spite of the food which his master
crammed into him, he would <em>not</em> grow fat. His bones protruded
in a highly objectionable manner. His head was
nearly double the size of that of any ordinary horse, and his
neck being very long, he found it extremely difficult to hold
it up. In consequence, a line drawn from the ears to the
tail would have touched the back at every point. Boston
hailed the appearance of this remarkable beast with a yell of
delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! What a hoss—what a hoss!”</p>

<p>Swedlepipe joined at once in the cry.</p>

<p>“Whose hoss you laughing at, you Yankee? Dat hoss
you sell to Swedlepipe a <em>little</em> worse, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I calculate you are wrong there, Mister Longshanks.
Why, I know that hoss you are riding. He is forty years
old. Some say that he was brought over in the Mayflower;
some say not. A man like you oughtn’t to ride such a horse.
Look at Mynheer Swedlepipe, and see what a hoss <em>he</em> rides! I
s’pose you have heard how I sold the other one to him.
That was all a mistake, and I have made it all right. Haven’t
I, Mynheer Swedlepipe?”</p>

<p>“Yaw;” said Paul. “Dat ish goot now; dat vash bad
hoss, dis ish goot von.”</p>

<p>Ten Eyck looked at the prancing pony with infinite disgust.
Such was the nature of the two men, that one could not bear
to have the other possess any thing which he could not get.
Every prance of the Narragansett, every shake of his long
tail, went to the tall man’s very heart. As for Swedlepipe,
his face fairly beamed with exultation, and he stuttered in
his joy, when he attempted to speak.</p>

<p>“The fact is, Mynheer Ten Eyck,” said Boston, “you
don’t know who to buy a horse of, and you get cheated. Now
I will tell you, in confidence, that there are several men in
Windsor who would not hesitate to cheat you, upon any occasion.
But, I have a character to lose; I must deal in a
good article. If I sell you bad goods or a bad hoss, you will
not buy of me again. Do you see?”</p>

<p>Ten Eyck saw.</p>

<p>“Very good, then. If you had bought a horse from me, it
would have been a good one, if you paid me a <em>good price</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Of course you wouldn’t expect a very good horse for a very
poor price. That’s plain enough, is it not?”</p>

<p>“You got long tongue, Boston,” said Ten Eyck. “Have
you got a hoss to sell?”</p>

<p>“I can’t rightly say that I have a hoss just now. But I
know where I can put my hand upon one within five
hours.”</p>

<p>“Steal him?”</p>

<p>“You say that again, and I’ll drive your long legs four feet
into the ground,” cried Boston, turning upon the Dutchman in
sudden wrath. “Hark ye, sir. I am a plain man, and I
speak plain language. In the way of trade I’ll get as much
out of a man for as little in return, as any man in the five
colonies. But, I won’t take ‘thief’ from any man. So look
out.”</p>

<p>Ten Eyck almost fell from his horse in fear, and hastened
to disclaim any personal allusion in his question.</p>

<p>“All right. Now I’ll answer your question. This hoss
is where I can get him easily. All you have got to do is to
ride home, and come again about five this evening to Paul
Swedlepipe’s. You can see the hoss there.”</p>

<p>Turning up his nose at Paul Swedlepipe, and applying his
heels to the sides of the remarkable courser he bestrode,
Ten Eyck rode away, bobbing up and down in his saddle like
a dancing-Jack.</p>

<p>“Now, Paul,” said Boston, “I want your help. Where is
this hoss I sold you the other day?”</p>

<p>“Out in de bush.”</p>

<p>“Send for him.”</p>

<p>“What you want of him?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind; he is mine, and I want him. And
mind, I also want the teeth and tail I sold with him. Them
I must have.”</p>

<p>Paul called to one of his boys, and sent him after the horse,
while he himself produced the tail and teeth which he had
carefully preserved. The boy returned in about an hour,
during which Paul and the hawker imbibed large quantities
of apple-jack, not strong enough, however, to unsettle their
ideas. When the boy appeared, Boston took the bridle of
the horse, and led him away, closely followed by Swedlepipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Reaching an open glade in the forest, the peddler stopped,
and tethered the horse to a swaying limb. He then took
from his pack a keen lancet, with which he made a small
incision in the skin under the shoulder of the beast. In this
slit he inserted a quill, and begun to blow. Those accustomed
to the management of a horse know the effect of this. In a
few moments Paul, who stood looking on in open-mouthed
wonder, did not know the horse, who seemed to grow fat
under the hands of the skillful jockey.</p>

<p>After he had blown the animal up to a wholesome plumpness,
Boston nicely and tightly sewed up the small incision.
Then taking from his pack a small vial, he filled a large
gourd which he had brought from the house with water from
the spring, and poured into it the contents of the vial. The
water at once assumed a greenish hue. With this mixture
he now washed the horse thoroughly in every part, keeping
him carefully in the shade. This done, he led him out into
the sunlight, and, to the intense astonishment of Paul Swedlepipe,
by some chemical action of the sun upon the mixture,
the horse changed at once from a dirty white to a delicate
shade of brown. Raising his hands upward, as if calling
witnesses to his astonishment, the Dutchman cried:</p>

<p>“Der tuyvel is upon earth. You ish der tuyvel!”</p>

<p>“No, Paul. A lineal descendant of the old fellow, though.
Do you think I could sell that horse to Ten Eyck?”</p>

<p>“Yaw. He is so goot changed he would sheat me again.
I never puys nottings from you no more.”</p>

<p>“He must stand in the sun for a couple of hours, to let
the color fasten, and then we will take him up to the house.
Now let me put you up to a wrinkle. When Ten Eyck
comes for the horse, I want you to bid against him.”</p>

<p>“Vat ish dat?”</p>

<p>“If he offers forty guilders for him, you must offer fifty.”</p>

<p>“For dat hoss? I no wants dat hoss.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t have him. Of course Ten Eyck will bid
sixty. You will then say seventy.”</p>

<p>“Yaw, put I ton’t vant dat hoss.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I only want you to <em>bid</em>, and when I think he
has offered enough, I shall wink to you, and you must stop
bidding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Put I needn’t have te hoss, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, you blockhead! Do as I tell you, if you want him
to buy the horse.”</p>

<p>All this while, however, the Yankee was at work putting
on the alien tail and putting in the ejected teeth, which, instead
of being tied in, as Paul had said, were, in truth wired
together with a skill which a modern dentist might have
envied. It must have cost Boston time and patience to have
produced such a double row of horse-incisors and molars; but
he accomplished the task quite to his satisfaction—“good
enough to deceive a dumb Dutchman,” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>It took some time to drum into Swedlepipe’s head that he
was only required to make Peter Funk bids against the destined
victim. Boston knew full well that if he <em>sold</em> Ten
Eyck he would make a powerful enemy, as the tall man was
high in power in the House of Good Hope. But, the events
which he knew were on the march made him careless of consequences.
Ten Eyck came at the appointed time, and found
the two seated amicably over some long pipes and a goodly
measure of apple-jack.</p>

<p>“Vere is dat hoss?” he said.</p>

<p>“Outside,” said Boston. “Let’s go out and see him. Oh,
by the way, since you were here my friend Swedlepipe has
seen this horse and has taken a fancy to it. I am afraid he
will bid against you.”</p>

<p>“You promised him to me.”</p>

<p>“I promised to <em>show</em> you a hoss, and I will keep my word.
Come, mynheer, let us go together.”</p>

<p>The horse was now tied in a little inclosure at the back of
the house, whither the party now wended their way. Boston’s
jockey-training had not been in vain, and it was really a
handsome beast to look at!</p>

<p>“Now, den,” said Ten Eyck, taking out a plethoric purse,
“vat you ask for dat hoss?”</p>

<p>“I don’t set any price for him,” replied Boston. “What
do you think he is worth.”</p>

<p>“I gif’s you vifty guilders.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Mynheer Swedlepipe? Shall I let it
go for that? I leave it entirely to you.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Paul. “I gif’s sixty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“You try to git dat hoss, <em>pudding-head</em>,” cried the other;
“I gif’s seventy guilders.”</p>

<p>It is needless to follow the course of the trade—to give the
words which passed between the bidders—how Paul, forgetting
that he was only bidding in jest, refused to stop when
Boston winked at him, but bid higher! Affairs trembled in
the balance. Ten Eyck looked at the horse and his rival, and
swore in his inmost soul to have the beast, if it took every
guilder from his purse. He bid higher, and while he cogitated,
Boston had winked Paul into submission.</p>

<p>“One hundred and fifty guilders,” said Boston. “It’s a
good pile. You don’t go any higher, Mynheer Swedlepipe?”</p>

<p>“Nein,” said Paul.</p>

<p>“Then you may have him, Ten Eyck. It’s as good a <em>sell</em> as
you ever heard on, I guess.”</p>

<p>The last named individual counted out the money, bestrode
the transformed beast, and rode away to his home, while Paul,
falling prostrate upon the earth, hugged himself, and shouted
with laughter. Boston, chinking the money in his purse,
uttered a satisfied chuckle, and went his way.</p>

<p>The hawker did not stay in the settlement, though the sun
was low in the forest, and the Indians were thick as the deer,
and bloody as the panther. Once in the woods, and out of
sight of the village, he deftly hid his pack beside a fallen tree,
drew out a beautiful gun from its place of concealment, and
assumed an active, erect attitude, much unlike the slouching
gait which had marked his course in the village. He cast a
keen glance about him, and begun to load his piece before he
set forward on the trail. This done, he tightened his belt,
took a hasty glance at the sky, and buried himself in the
woods.</p>

<p>The forest path along which he journeyed was tangled, and
covered by fallen leaves, in which his feet fell with a slight
rustle. At times the deer started up from a thicket, and went
crashing away. At others the brown bear went lumbering
over the path, casting a surly glance over her shoulder at the
strange intruder upon her native woods. The warning rattle
of the venomous snake sounded in his ear; the howl of a distant
panther was heard. Such were the sights and sounds
of a Connecticut forest, in those early times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The change in the man who trod the forest path was wonderful.
No longer the peddler keen for a trade, and seeing
only the main chance, but a sharp, vigilant woodman, ready
for any emergency which might arise.</p>

<p>As he passed through a thick part of the woods, a confused
sound came to his ears, as of a struggle among the dry leaves.
Dashing aside the branches, with a hasty step he broke into
an open place in the forest, and looked in upon a strange
scene.</p>

<p>The glade was not empty. Two men lay upon the ground,
engaged in a struggle for life or death. Their quick, panting
breaths came to Boston’s ears. Drawing his knife, he rushed
forward, shouting:</p>

<p>“Hold your hands! He who strikes another stroke will
have me to fight.”</p>

<p>The two men rose slowly and sullenly to their feet, casting
looks of hate at each other. One, however, recognizing
Boston, extended a hand, giving him a cheerful welcome.</p>

<p>“But what means this, William Barlow? How is it that
I find you brawling like a boy with a stranger, when you
have weighty affairs to attend to? By my faith, I did not
look for this at your hands!”</p>

<p>The person he addressed was young, and clad in the uniform
of the early Connecticut soldiery. His form was erect,
and his bearing that of a soldier. He bent down his eyes,
wonderful as it may seem, at the words of the peddler.</p>

<p>“You are right, Boston, in saying that I had no right to
quarrel. But it was forced upon me against my will. Yonder
man will tell you that this quarrel is none of my seeking.”</p>

<p>The person of whom he spoke had stood upon his guard,
drawing his sword, and expecting to fight both men when they
had done with their conference. He, too, had the erect bearing
of the soldier, and <em>his</em> dress was that of captain of the
soldiers at Manhattan. His face was a study. Seen in repose,
it was beautiful, for a man. But now, with his anger
fresh upon him, it seemed the face of a fiend. This was
Joseph Van Zandt, captain in the army of the governor at
New Netherlands, a brave soldier, but an unscrupulous
foe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it will aid you,” said he, “I do not hesitate to say that
I forced this quarrel upon Lieutenant Barlow.”</p>

<p>“So sure as my name is Boston Bainbridge,” said that
worthy, “I could give you no worse punishment than to leave
you in the hands of Willie Barlow. I have not the least doubt
he would give a good account of you. But, it may not be.
How came this quarrel about?”</p>

<p>“I met him here,” said Barlow, “and he talked in a friendly
tone at first; but when I gave my name he drew upon me
with the utmost fury.”</p>

<p>“Why was this, sir?” asked Boston, turning to the captain.
“Can not men meet in the forest, but they must fight
like dogs?”</p>

<p>“Ask me no questions. I do not recognize your right to
do so. It is enough for me to know that the name of the
man who stands by your side is so hateful to me that I am
his enemy to the death.”</p>

<p>“You are over bold, sir,” said Boston, setting his teeth
hard. “What hope have you, if we two set upon you
together.”</p>

<p>“The hope of a man and a soldier,” replied Captain Van
Zandt, quickly. “I may fall, or I may conquer. Set on!”</p>

<p>“I did not say we would attack you. We are peaceful
men, and do not pick quarrels with every man whose name
does not suit us.”</p>

<p>“Let <em>him</em> ask me why I hate the name he bears,” replied
the other, “and I will tell him. That is, if he cares to
know.”</p>

<p>“If you choose to tell,” said Willie, “I should like to hear;
for, by my faith, I never offended you in the slightest degree.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you. Because you took advantage of your
position as ambassador from the Plymouth Colony, and tried
to win away from me my affianced wife, Theresa Van
Curter.”</p>

<p>Willie took a forward step, and addressed the young man
boldly:</p>

<p>“I am glad you have spoken,” said he. “We now understand
each other. While I fought with you a few moments
since, I was angry at myself, because I fought with a man
with whom I had no quarrel. I am best pleased that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
have told me what cause we have to be bad friends. And
yet, I can not feel that it is necessary to fight. Let the one
who can win the heart of Theresa Van Curter take her for a
wife, and let the other do as best he may. If you win her, I
shall bid you God-speed. If I win, you may do the same.
Is not this the nobler way?”</p>

<p>“Such sickly philosophy may do for you Englishmen,”
answered the other, coldly. “As for me, I am not of such
blood. I love Theresa. She has been a guide to me through
life—my leading star. I will not lose her now, when the
time has come when she was promised to me. Will you give
her up?”</p>

<p>“Not I. If I have any place in her heart, I would not
yield it for any living man.”</p>

<p>“Be it so then. We are enemies from this hour. When
we fight again it shall be where no man can come between.
Do you intend to detain me, sir? I do not know your name.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Go your way and leave us to go ours,” said
Boston.</p>

<p>The captain turned hastily away, for it was now quite dark
in the forest, and made his way to the river-side, where he
expected to meet a party from the House of Good Hope, sent
to meet him by Van Curter. The two men, being left alone
in the forest, did not remain in the place where they stood, but
hastened away to the river-side, by a different route. Here
they entered one of the limestone caves, found on the river’s
bank. The peddler lighted a pine torch. Then the two sat
down to talk.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">BOSTON AS A MISCHIEF-MAKER.</span></h2>

<p>Theresa had met the young Englishman on an embassay to
Manhattan, as Captain Van Zandt had said. Their love had
been a plant of quick growth, and her father learned too late
that her heart was given to Willie. She had been betrothed
in youth to young Van Zandt, the son of an old comrade in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
arms. Hence the knowledge made the fiery colonel particularly
angry. In his rage, Van Curter had sent a messenger
to Joseph, desiring his presence at Good Hope. Every thing
being remarkably quiet in the Manhattan settlement, just then,
the captain readily obtained leave of absence. While on his
way to the House of Good Hope, by the river, he met the
young lieutenant, who was evidently waiting for somebody,
on the river’s bank. Retiring as the boat-load of Manhattaners
approached, Barlow was followed into the forest by the
captain. Not being a man to run from a Manhattaner, Barlow
paused, and, as we have seen, closed in mortal combat.</p>

<p>It was the desire of Van Curter to hurry on the marriage
by every means in his power. But, at present, his whole attention
was turned to a project for driving the English from
Windsor. He saw, with increasing fear, that the domineering
Yankees were spreading more and more through the country,
and that, unless checked by some means, they would soon
possess the whole country. The transactions carried on by
our English ancestors, of which the dealings of Boston Bainbridge
was a fair type, were enough to drive that well-intentioned
people stark mad. No wonder, therefore, that they
concocted a plan for the possession of Windsor, on the river
above Good Hope.</p>

<p>Captain Holmes had set up this post, as has been suggested,
in direct opposition to the wishes of Van Curter. The
dialogue which passed between them as the English sloop
passed up the stream, was so characteristic of the two men,
that we repeat it:</p>

<p>“Where would you go?” cried Van Curter.</p>

<p>“Up the river, to trade,” replied Holmes.</p>

<p>“Strike and stay!” shouted the commandant, “or I will
fire into you.”</p>

<p>“Fire and be hanged,” returned Holmes. “The river is
mine as much as your own.”</p>

<p>Van Curter thought better of it, and did not fire. The
sloop passed up the stream, and founded the post which afterward
awakened the Dutchman’s ire to such an extent.</p>

<p>It was night when Joseph Van Zandt arrived at Good
Hope, and he went at once to the cabin of Van Curter. He
had not retired, but sat alone at a table, by a flaring lamp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
writing a dispatch to the governor. He started up in great
joy at the sight of the captain, and held out both hands to
him.</p>

<p>“Sit thee down, lad. Thou art welcome. How go things
in the Manhattoes?”</p>

<p>“Very fairly. Can you say as much of this colony?”</p>

<p>“No. The Yankees advance step by step, and the time is
not far off when we shall be driven entirely away, unless we
do something ourselves. But, I have a plan in my mind,
Joseph—I have a plan; and, faith, it is a good one. How
long have you been on the way?”</p>

<p>“Four days. I should have been here ere now, but my
horse got his foot into a stocking on the road, and broke it. I
was forced to shoot it and take to the sound and river.”</p>

<p>“That is bad; but I think we can supply you. Ten Eyck
bragged to-day, in the council, that he had the best horse in
the colony. It ought to be, if he paid the price he says he
did, which is a hundred and fifty guilders. You ought to
have seen Paul Swedlepipe’s face while Ten Eyck told about
that horse.”</p>

<p>“What? Do they keep up the old feud yet?”</p>

<p>“Stronger than ever, my dear Joseph. But, what puzzled
me most was, that Paul seemed to work hard to refrain
from laughing, when he ought to have felt more like crying.
It looked suspicious to me.”</p>

<p>“Has any one else seen the horse?”</p>

<p>“Yes—several of the council. And they all agree that it
is a good beast. Most wonderful of all, he was sold by a
Yankee. Swedlepipe bid as high as a hundred and forty
guilders before he would give up. But that a Yankee should
sell a good horse! Who ever heard of such a thing?”</p>

<p>Joseph laughed at this, but he was not so far from Good
Hope as not to know that Yankees did not sell good wares.</p>

<p>“We will see this wonderful beast to-morrow, and if he is
any thing like what he is reported, I shall want him. Whom
think you I met in the forest?”</p>

<p>“I could not guess.”</p>

<p>“You will hardly believe it. A man whom I never saw
but once in my life, and whom I hate, for all that, with all
my soul.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who may that be?”</p>

<p>“William Barlow.”</p>

<p>Colonel Van Curter leaped to his feet. “I swear by the bones
of my father, that if Boston Bainbridge dares to show his
face again in Good Hope, I will crop his ears off close to his
head, and turn him off.”</p>

<p>“Boston Bainbridge!”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“That is the very man who came between us. You must
know, then, that I followed this man Barlow into the woods,
and soon had him at bay, curse him! We were down upon
the earth, tearing at each other’s throats, so closely grappled
that we could not use our swords, when this man rushed in
and parted us, swearing to strike the one who made another
stroke—a daring, resolute fellow, I saw at a glance.”</p>

<p>“You astonish me. It can not be the man I mean. The
Bainbridge I knew is a sneaking dog of a hawker, who has
made more mischief in Good Hope than any ten men I know.
But he is a pitiful wretch, who will do almost any thing for
money.”</p>

<p>“This man was as determined-looking a fellow as I ever
saw in my life, I am certain; and looked as if a fight was
meat and drink to him. And what is more, your friend
Barlow deferred to him as to a superior.”</p>

<p>“It can not be that there are two. The fellow showed
some spirit to-day, and all the information I got out of him
did not amount to much. You may be right; it may be
the hawker—confound him! But I am at a loss. Did he
have his pack?”</p>

<p>“No. He was armed, though, with musket, knife and
pistols, and looked an ugly customer.”</p>

<p>“Let it pass. As to the Boston Bainbridge who is known
to me, we shall have something to say to each other when we
next meet. If it is the one who is known to you, we may
have something else to say to him. You say you quarreled
with Barlow.”</p>

<p>“Yes. The very name of the fellow aroused me to rage.
I struck him with my open hand in the face—and we fought.
This Bainbridge came between; but it is a quarrel to the
death. In the first burst, he spoke quite angrily to Barlow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as one who had a right to do it, and the young man appeared
ashamed.”</p>

<p>“What can it mean?” said Van Curter, uneasily. “This
fills me with doubts and fears which I can not fathom. Did
you leave them together?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the forest, a league or more from Good Hope.”</p>

<p>“It must be Bainbridge,” mused Van Curter. “He is the
sworn friend of Barlow; and yet, the new character you give
him is so utterly unlike the one he has borne, that I can’t understand
it at all.”</p>

<p>“Let us speak of something else. Does Theresa know of
my coming?”</p>

<p>“No; I thought it would be a pleasant surprise for her.”</p>

<p>Van Zandt set his teeth hard at the words, for he realized,
only too painfully, that any thing like love for him was now
foreign to the heart of Theresa. The old soldier knew that he
was angry, and wisely allowed him his own time to answer.
When the captain had controlled himself sufficiently to speak,
he said:</p>

<p>“I have my fears upon the subject—I am afraid I shall
never get my own. You have promised me the hand of
Theresa; I have waited for it long years; but I have always
feared that something would come between me and the promise.
It <em>has</em> come.”</p>

<p>“Do you fear this Barlow?” asked the other, in some contempt.
“Have you not an honored name—a name second to
none in our own land? Have you not the most handsome
face in the seven colonies? Bah!”</p>

<p>“You are old, Colonel Van Curter, and you do not know a
woman’s heart, after all. I tell you that I have made woman
a study; they claim to be influenced by personal beauty in
man; but, put them to the test, and you will find that, after
all, the most beautiful women make a choice of men who,
though plain in person, are the only ones who can find the
road to their hearts.”</p>

<p>“In truth, you may be right; but you may be the one
who has the key to Theresa’s heart. You <em>shall</em> be, by
heaven!”</p>

<p>“Would you force her to marry me against her inclination?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would keep my word to your father, even if I had to use
force.”</p>


<p>“I would not have her upon such terms,” said the young
man. “She must be mine entirely, heart and hand; if it can
not be so, I renounce her hand, and apply myself to the task
of taking worthy vengeance upon the man who has dared to
step in between me and the love of the woman I prize highest.
I know him, I thank God. He can not escape me. Where is
Theresa?”</p>


<p>“She has retired.”</p>

<p>“There will be a meeting, I am sure, between her and this
Yankee. We must watch.”</p>

<p>“This is the work of Bainbridge; he has gone between
them, carried letter after letter, and been the means of making
her fancy stronger; he, too, has something which will draw
him back to this place.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Katrine.”</p>

<p>“Bah!”</p>

<p>“She is a beauty not to be despised, and her family is good—she
is first cousin to Theresa.”</p>

<p>“Right, I forgot; but I have not seen her for years. Do
you know that in coming up the river, I fancied I was followed
by a canoe part of the way.”</p>

<p>“Indians?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; come nearer, and I will tell you my secret
plans about Windsor and the English, whom I am determined
to baffle and defeat.”</p>

<p>The men drew close together, and looked over the paper.
As they did so a face rose slowly into view on the other side
of the room, peering in at the open lattice. It was the face
of Boston Bainbridge.</p>

<p>“You are sure no one listens?” asked Joseph.</p>

<p>“Ay; my men know better than to listen at the windows
or doors of Jacob Van Curter; I would string them up to a
swaying limb, or give them forty stripes, save one.”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a sound, a moment since.”</p>

<p>“The girls, perhaps; open that door, and look into the
kitchen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Joseph rose and opened the door; the kitchen was empty;
the fire burned low upon the hearth, and the rays danced
upon the dishes in the dresser.</p>

<p>“You heard the wind,” said Van Curter; “it is rising fast.
It will rain to-night.”</p>

<p>“I am glad I got in safe before the storm. Hark to
that.”</p>

<p>The wind was rising with a sullen and fast-increasing roar;
in a few moments the rain begun to fall. Joseph stirred the
fire with a feeling of enjoyment, and the two drew up to the
table.</p>

<p>“You remember this Captain Holmes—my curse upon his
head—who would not pause when I told him to strike and
stay?” said Van Curter.</p>

<p>“I remember him well.”</p>

<p>“He commands this post at Windsor; if any thing would
make me long to take the post more than another, it would
be the fact that I hate him. To him we may trace the
entrance of these Yankees into our midst.”</p>

<p>“Did you not invite them to settle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, fool that I was to do it; but I did not know them
then as I do now. I would as soon have let in fiends from
the pit.”</p>

<p>“Then they are not to blame for hanging on to their possessions.
You should not have asked them here.”</p>

<p>“They have learned to despise us, because we are so easily
taken in. They are right in that; a greater set of dunderheads
than those under my command never congregated before.
If it were not for two or three of my officers, my blockheads
would have their teeth drawn in the night, and never
know it.”</p>

<p>“What slander upon such men as the worthy Paul Swedlepipe
and Mynheer Ten Eyck.”</p>

<p>“There you have a specimen. What can a man do who
must be guided, in a manner, by the advice of such men as
those? It is enough to make one give up in despair.”</p>

<p>“But they will fight, if it is necessary.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is their only redeeming quality. They are too
thick-headed to appreciate the danger. But to my plan. I
shall march out with forty men in the night, and get near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
enough to Windsor to attack them early in the morning. We
will take the fellows prisoners and send them to the nearest
English post.”</p>

<p>“Very good; how many men can the English muster?”</p>

<p>“Not over twenty, and those we will take by surprise.”</p>

<p>“Captain Holmes is there.”</p>

<p>“Yes. His brother is next in command, and Barlow
next. I should not care to fight them if they are on their
guard.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of this brother of Holmes’.”</p>

<p>“He has never been in Good Hope; I do not know that I
have seen him. He is represented as a man under forty,
active, vigilant and acute—a man formed by nature for a life
in the woods.”</p>

<p>“You describe such a man as I take this very Bainbridge
to be.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken; I know the man well; he may have
taken the attitude of a brave man because they were two to
one; but, in reality, he is one of the most egregious cowards
upon the face of the earth.”</p>

<p>“This is pleasant news to come to a man’s ears,” muttered
the peddler, lying <i lang="fr">perdu</i> beneath the shelter of the eaves.
“They say listeners never hear any good of themselves, and
I am not inclined to doubt it; but go on—go on, the time
will come to settle yet, and I will give you back that
coward in your teeth. Phew! how the rain comes down.”</p>

<p>“The Windsor people are not in a very strong stockade,
and I think I may succeed. I shall march on the afternoon
of to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Who will you leave here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know certainly. We shall not be long gone, and I
think one of my blockheads may be trusted for a day. Come,
taste this aqua vitæ, which was sent to me from Manhattan by
my worthy friend, Wilhelem Kieft, and then to bed, to be
ready for the morning. ’Tis a wild night.”</p>

<p>They sat talking for some time over the liquor, and then
went to their couches. Boston wrapped himself warmly in a
wolf-skin robe which lay upon the porch, and lay down to
rest; he slept two hours. When he arose, the storm was at
its height, and he could move about the house with perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
impunity. Walking quickly to a window-lattice on the south,
he gave a single tap upon it, and waited. The tap was
answered from within, and the lattice was raised to allow
Katrine to thrust out her head. She looked so provokingly
sweet that Boston solaced himself with a kiss before a word
was said.</p>

<p>“Impudence!” whispered the girl. “I shall close the
lattice.”</p>

<p>“No you won’t, my dear. Where is Theresa?”</p>

<p>“Like your impudence to ask. She is in bed, and you
ought to be in yours, instead of tramping about on such a
night as this.”</p>

<p>“We have no time to talk. Go in and wake Theresa, and
tell her to open her lattice in half an hour, for one she
wots of will come to her before that time.”</p>

<p>“You are crazy, both of you. It is death for you to be
near Good Hope to-night. Do you not know that Captain
Van Zandt is here, and that he spares none who stand in his
way?”</p>

<p>“Little care we,” replied the other, snapping his fingers,
“for Captain Joseph Van Zandt. We know more of his
movements than you think, Katrine. But get you gone, and
tell Theresa that Willie is here. When you have done that,
come back to me.”</p>

<p>“You speak sometimes like one born to command” said
Katrine, looking at him fixedly. “If it should be so—if you
<em>should</em> deceive me!”</p>

<p>“Katrine, you mistrust me. Have I ever given you
cause?”</p>

<p>She was back in a moment, with one soft arm about his
neck. “I trust you,” was all she said.</p>

<p>“I <em>have</em> a secret from you, my darling,” he said, returning
her embrace. “But, take this to your heart—whatever your
station, whatever mine, I love you entirely. Now, go.”</p>

<p>She opened the door which led into the room of Theresa.
She found her awake, with her head bowed upon a table.
Katrine was not so much a servant as a dear friend to Theresa,
and she passed her arm about her kindly, as she asked why
she was sad.</p>

<p>“He is here,” was the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Van Zandt.”</p>

<p>“I know that; but why should you fear him? Your lover
will never see you forced to be his wife. I will not. My
lover will not.”</p>

<p>“Alas, what can they do? Willie is far away.”</p>

<p>“Not so far as you may imagine. I heard a tapping at
my window just now. I opened it, and who do you suppose
was there?”</p>

<p>“Hans Drinker,” said Theresa, with a smile, for she
knew that the worthy Dutchman persecuted poor Katrine
to the verge of distraction.</p>

<p>“If I served you rightly,” said Katrine,“I should go back
to my room, and not tell you a single word.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t. Who was it? Carl Anselm?”</p>

<p>“Be careful! It was Bainbridge.”</p>

<p>“I knew he was here. Did he say any thing about Willie?”</p>

<p>“He told me to bid you rise, and be at your lattice in half
an hour, for Willie Barlow would then be there.”</p>

<p>Theresa clasped her hands in fervent thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“You have brought glad tidings, dear Katrine,” she said.
“Sit with me until he comes. Ah, what is he doing in this
frightful storm?”</p>

<p>“It is enough that he is here. You should have seen poor
Boston. Wet—oh, so wet! Like one drownded cat.”</p>

<p>The two sat with clasped hands until a tap came at the
lattice. Theresa rose and opened it softly.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Willie,” he replied. Hands and lips met. That hour
could not be forgotten, in any after pain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE HUMAN COLLISION AND HORSE COLLAPSE.</span></h2>

<p>The meeting between the lovers was long, and it was only
the wise council of Boston which induced them at length to
separate. He had moved away a little from the window,
and was calling in a low tone upon Willie to make haste,
when a chamber lattice was thrown rudely back, and a gun
protruded. It was Captain Van Zandt who had heard voices.</p>

<p>“Come away,” cried Boston, now careless. “You will
spoil all. Obey me, Sir Lieutenant!”</p>

<p>“How dare he speak in that way?” thought Katrine.</p>

<p>Willie, imprinting a farewell kiss upon the willing lips of
Theresa, bounded away. A stream of fire leaped from the
muzzle of the musket of Van Zandt. A mocking laugh came
back in response. Without a moment’s hesitation, he leaped
from the window, sword in hand, calling upon Van Curter,
who was up and armed by this time, to follow. It is a maxim
which all woodsmen should heed, not to follow an enemy
<em>too</em> closely in the dark. But, an angry man is not apt to take
maxims to heart. Van Zandt had recognized the voice of
the peddler, and heard him call “Willie,” and knew full well
who were the intruders and their business.</p>

<p>Boston did not run far. Reaching the edge of a little
thicket, he paused, and waited for the captain, who was only
a few feet behind, hurrying forward at his best pace; when
Boston, making a single forward step, dealt a blow with such
fullness and force, that the furious soldier went down like an
ox under the ax of the butcher. No one, looking at the light
frame of the peddler, would have imagined for a moment that
his muscles were developed to such an extent. No sooner
was the blow struck, than he grasped Willie by the arm and
hurried him forward at a quick pace, leaving Van Zandt prostrate
upon the earth.</p>

<p>“Have you hurt him badly?” inquired Willie.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I hit him behind the ear in the way you wot
of. I did not care to use my weapons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are right. What shall we do now? I am afraid
you have betrayed yourself. You called out, ‘obey me!’ in
a way that made me start.”</p>

<p>“Katrine suspects too, the little darling. I have promised
to tell her the secret. She shall know it when the house of
Good Hope is ours.”</p>

<p>“You have hope, then?”</p>

<p>“When I shall tell you what I have heard this night from
the lips of Jacob Van Curter, you will understand why I have
hope. But, we can not stay now. We must go to Windsor
at once. We know the river, and our canoe is at hand.”</p>

<p>“I am ready to go.”</p>

<p>As they glided from the shore, Van Curter stumbled over
the prostrate form of Joseph. This aroused the captain, and
he staggered to his feet, making a weak attack upon his
friend, who parried his blows with great ease.</p>

<p>“You are mad. It’s I, Van Curter.”</p>

<p>Van Zandt came to his senses.</p>

<p>“I believe I am crazy,” he said. “But what a blow. My
head seems split asunder.”</p>

<p>“What did he strike you with? Ho, there, Hans! Bring
the torch hither. What did he strike you with?”</p>

<p>“It seemed like a clinched hand. And it can not be that
a human hand should have such power. I would sooner be
kicked by a horse than take such another blow.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who struck you?”</p>

<p>“Not I; though when the blow came every sun, moon
and star in a clear sky seemed to blaze close before my eyes.
By my faith, I am dizzy yet.”</p>

<p>“I should think you were. Lean upon me, and let us return
to the house. Do you know who they were?”</p>

<p>“Surely. Who should it be but the worshipful Lieutenant
Barlow, and his friend Bainbridge. I tell you again that he
is something more than he shows upon the outside. S’death,
man, he called out to the lieutenant like a master, I can tell
you, and he came at his call.”</p>

<p>“What was it all about?”</p>

<p>“I heard voices under my window, and listened. It was
Theresa talking with Barlow. I threw open my window and
called upon him to speak. But Bainbridge called to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
comrade to come away, and I missed him—it was very
dark.”</p>

<p>“By the bones of my father!” cried Van Curter. “Has
it gone so far as that. Follow me.”</p>

<p>He strode into the house, and knocked heavily at his
daughter’s door, ordering her to come forth. She did so,
with her garments thrown loosely about her. She greeted the
young man in a hesitating manner, which went to his heart.</p>

<p>“How is this?” said her father, harshly. “Who dares
to come to Good Hope in the dead of night, to meet the
daughter of a Van Curter? Where is your womanhood, girl?
Can you think of this and not blush?”</p>

<p>Theresa had much of her father’s untamable spirit, and answered
quickly:</p>

<p>“It is no shame to meet one whom I love! And I take no
fear in saying that I love Willie Barlow.”</p>

<p>“Say you so? Am I bearded to my face by a child of
mine? Look upon Joseph Van Zandt. You were promised
to him long ago. He has waited long years until this hour.
And now you—you, of all others, spit upon the contract of
your father, and plight your faith to one of alien blood!
While I live, it shall never be.”</p>

<p>Theresa did not lower her eyes, but met the angry orbs of
her father with a full glance.</p>

<p>“Speak no more of Joseph Van Zandt. Joseph, I am very
sorry that you have set your heart upon a thing which can
never be. I do not love you. But, if report says true, you
would not have far to go to find one who would be true to
you in wedlock. But <em>I</em> love you not as a wife should love,
and I never can be yours.”</p>

<p>Van Zandt looked at her a moment, the fierce anger in his
heart blazing in his eyes. He had waited long years for Theresa—had
seen her grow more beautiful, day by day, and now,
the torture of hearing her say that she loved him not! He
raised his clinched hand on high, and brought it down upon
the table with a force which made the glasses ring again.</p>

<p>“God in his mercy keep him out of my sight, or I shall
kill him,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Father!” she cried, “look upon the man you would have
me marry. He is a murderer in his heart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“So am I,” her parent answered, moodily. “Girl, get you
in. You shall wed Joseph, as I am your father.”</p>

<p>“I would not have it so,” said Joseph. “I marry no unwilling
wife. But him—let him take care!”</p>

<p>“What would you do?” she half-screamed.</p>

<p>“Murder! You have described the feelings of my heart.
If he cross not my path, well—he is safe. But, if I meet
him, God do so to me, and more also, if both leave the ground
alive!”</p>

<p>“He is mad,” she said.</p>

<p>“You have made me so—you, with your accursed beauty.
Blame that, and nothing more.”</p>

<p>“Get you in, I say,” cried Van Curter. “Do you still tarry
to madden him the more? Get to bed! As for you, Joseph,
go to your room and try to get a little sleep. Remember that
in the morning we prepare for the march.”</p>

<p>“You are right. Now she is gone, I am a man again. I
tell you she maddens me. I did not mean to tell her that,
when I spoke. Let him look to himself, the alien dog!”</p>

<p>“You will have the chance, Joseph, as we march against
him, to do away with him forever. Come, be a man.”</p>

<p>“I am. You have seen me fight, and know my power. I
shall do good service if it comes to blows.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Go to your room and get a little sleep. You
will need it. To-morrow we shall see Ten Eyck, and secure
his horse for your service.”</p>

<p>“Will he sell it?”</p>

<p>“I shall give him command while we are gone. That will
make him ready to do any thing. Good-night.”</p>

<p>Joseph went up to his room and sat at the open window.
The rain drifted in his face, but he heeded it not. He could
hear Van Curter tramping to and fro in his room, and the
voices of Theresa and Katrine in low conversation below.
Before morning, he dropped into an uneasy slumber, with his
head upon the sill. He was waked by the sound of noisy
preparation in the open space below the window. He sprung
up at once, buckled his sword-belt about him, and went down.
He met Theresa in the large room in which he had seen her
the night before. Neither spoke a word; but the glance of
mingled repulsion and fear upon the one side, and of deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
threatening upon the other, was of greater expression than a
volume. He passed her quickly, with his spurs ringing upon
the hard floor, and went out into the open space, or parade of
the House of Good Hope. He was greeted by a cheer from
those of the men who recognized him, for Captain Van Zandt
was known far and near as a brave and skillful leader. He
called to his side a slender youth, who was cleaning a gun in
the corner of the parade. He had a strange face, sharp features,
with thin, cruel lips, receding forehead, and small, glittering,
deep-set eyes. The youth laid down the gun when
called by the captain, and followed him from the stockade to
a retired spot outside the works.</p>

<p>“Carl Anselm,” said the latter, stopping suddenly, and laying
his hand impressively upon the shoulder of the young
man, “do you owe me any thing?”</p>

<p>“A life!” said the boy, quickly.</p>

<p>“You have said often, Carl, that you would like to do me
a service. I do not remind you of your indebtedness to me
because I like to remind people of their obligations; but the
time has come when I need your help.”</p>

<p>“I have waited long,” said the young man. “When I lay
under the hand of the savage Mohawk, and you killed him, I
swore to repay you for the life you gave me. You have made
me happy. What would you have me do?”</p>

<p>“Do you know the road to the Nipmuck village of Wampset?”</p>

<p>“Yes; one of Wampset’s men was here but a day or two
ago.”</p>

<p>“Is it far?”</p>

<p>“Twenty miles—so the brave said.”</p>

<p>“It can be done, then. Take your arms and go to the village;
find the chief, Wampset, give him this wampum belt,
and tell him that the sender calls upon him to meet him at the
three hills above Windsor, at midnight, with all the men he
can muster. Do not fear for yourself; there is no Indian who
owns the sway of the Nipmucks or the Mohawks who would
lay a hand in anger upon the man who wears that belt. Put
it on.”</p>

<p>Carl encircled his waist with the wampum belt. “Shall I
go now?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and make haste; you must have a horse. Ha, Paul
Swedlepipe, come hither.”</p>

<p>That individual, who was passing in a great hurry, came up
at the call.</p>

<p>“Where is that Narragansett pony you bought from the
Yankee?”</p>

<p>“In my stable.”</p>

<p>“You must lend him to Carl. We are going on an expedition
in which you are to have an important trust. Can he
have the horse?”</p>

<p>“If you will be responsible for him, yes.”</p>

<p>“Go with him, Carl,” said the captain, turning away. “Do
not stop a moment to talk. Kill any one who attempts to stay
you. I know you are good and true. Good-by, and all luck
to you.”</p>

<p>In a few moments Carl Anselm, with the wampum belt
girt about his waist, rode out of Good Hope. The captain
stepped to the side of his horse for a parting word:</p>

<p>“Do you know William Barlow, the man who was in Good
Hope last night?”</p>

<p>“I have met him and know him perfectly by sight.”</p>

<p>“He is my enemy. Do you fear him?”</p>

<p>“I fear no man,” replied the youth, drawing himself up
proudly. “What would you have me do?”</p>

<p>“I tell you he is my enemy. Is not that enough for thee?
Say, shall he die, if you meet? Will you give him a grave
in the forest?”</p>

<p>“If knives are sharp or bullets dig deep—if water can
drown or fire burn, when we meet he shall die.”</p>

<p>“You are a friend indeed,” cried Joseph, grasping his hand.
“Go out upon your duty, with my thanks for your kindness.
And remember, that in me you always have a friend.”</p>

<p>They shook hands and parted, the young man riding swiftly
forward upon his way, along the bank of the “Happy River,”
while Joseph went back to the camp. On the way, he met
Van Curter, who asked him to go with him to secure the horse
of Ten Eyck.</p>

<p>That worthy was reposing in front of his house, smoking a
pipe in great enjoyment. He greeted the approach of the two
dignitaries with a nod of recognition, thinking in his heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
how he would crow over Paul Swedlepipe, who could not
boast of the honor of such a visit.</p>

<p>“Good-day, mynheer, good-day,” said Van Curter. “We
have agreed to go out against Windsor to-day, and, after considerable
discussion, my friend the captain and myself have
agreed upon a person to take command of Good Hope during
our absence.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Ten Eyck, watching the puff of smoke
which ascended in spiral rings from his fair, long pipe.</p>

<p>“What would you say to Paul Swedlepipe?” asked the
captain, with a touch of mischievous humor. “Would he be
a good man for the place?”</p>

<p>“What! Paul Swedlepipe? Do you insult me? I would
suggest that you go and get Hans Drinker’s boy, Jacob, and
give him command, before you take Paul Swedlepipe. To be
sure, little Jacob is a fool; but what of that? Paul is a fool,
too.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think Paul would do?”</p>

<p>“Nix, <em>no</em>, <span class="smcapuc">NO!</span>” he cried using all the negatives at his command.</p>

<p>“Well, we concluded, after due discussion, not to take Paul.
What do you say to Hans Drinker?”</p>

<p>“He is a bigger fool than Jacob!”</p>

<p>“Then <em>he</em> won’t do; and, in fact, we didn’t think of having
him. The man we have in our mind is one Ten Eyck!”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said he, without moving a muscle of his face, “that
is sensible! Oh, Saint Nicholas,” he thought, “won’t I crow
over that Paul Swedlepipe after this!” Then he added aloud:
“How many men do you leave with us?”</p>

<p>“Five. You won’t need many, as our expedition must be
kept secret. Mind that, and don’t blab.”</p>

<p>Ten Eyck nodded his head vigorously, and the captain
came to the principal object of the visit. “You bought a
horse yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Yaw,” said he.</p>

<p>“What did you give for him?”</p>

<p>“One hundred and fifty guilders.”</p>

<p>“Ah; the price is large. I want to see the horse. If he
is good, I will give you a hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p>“I sells him den. I puys him,” he went on, now using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
broken English, as it was more in sympathy with the subject,
“vor fear Paul Swedlepipe get him. Coom over unt see
him.”</p>

<p>The two men followed to the place where the beast had
spent the night. The reader will remember that a tremendous
rain had fallen during the night. The horse had been
shut up in a sort of corral of rails which, however, afforded
little shelter.</p>

<p>To describe the puffed-up and vainglorious manner in which
Ten Eyck approached the corral, would be in vain. He seemed
to grow taller, and his head was thrown back to such a
fearful extent that there seemed to be immediate danger of his
falling over on his back. Those familiar with the ballad
which some years since was the delight of the youngsters of
this country and of Merry England, “Lord Bateman,” will remember
the engraving representing that individual. Mynheer
Ten Eyck, approaching the corral, was his exact representative.
Mentally, he was crowing over his enemy at every step. They
entered the corral by a bar which was set in holes in two posts,
set upright, about eight feet apart. Ten Eyck put up the
bar, lest the spirited beast should attempt to escape.</p>

<p>Where was he? There, shivering in one corner of the corral,
was a strange animal, without tail or teeth, for he had
dropped them both in the night; a hide streaked here and
there with marks of the coloring-substance which Boston had
used in the metamorphosis; with drooping head and dejected
looks generally. Ten Eyck took in all at a glance. Sold!
fearfully and irrecoverably by the Yankee, aided and abetted
by Paul Swedlepipe!</p>

<p>“Where is your horse?” asked the captain. “Not this, I
hope!”</p>

<p>“You have been cheated again,” cried Van Curter.</p>

<p>Ten Eyck glared from side to side for an object upon which
to wreak his vengeance. In that unlucky moment Paul, who
had heard in some way that Joseph intended to buy the horse,
and had followed to see the fun, peeped over the rails. The
woebegone face of his enemy met his eye. It was too much.
He burst into a stentorian laugh. Ten Eyck turned, wrath
blazing from his eyes, and rushed at his foe. Nothing loth,
Paul tumbled into the inclosure and met him half-way. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
any other time, Ten Eyck would have known better than to
peril his fame in open battle. But, the last drop had been put
into the pot of his wrath, and it boiled over. They met, like
Ajax and Hector, in the center of the list, and great deeds
were achieved, whereof Good Hope rung for many a day. As
we have said, Paul was short and choleric, and ready for a
fray. The strokes of the combatants fell thick and fast. Ten
Eyck had armed himself, in hot haste, with the fallen tail of
the cause of the quarrel. Paul had caught up a more hurtful
weapon, a short cudgel, which he had found outside the corral.
At him, Paul! At him, Ten Eyck! Now Hector! Now
Ajax! It was the Battle of the Giants. The horse-tail swept
the air with a whistling sound and lighted with stinging force
upon the face of Paul. The cudgel cracked upon the crown
of Ten Eyck, and twice brought him to his knee. The two
lookers-on would not interfere, for they knew the quarrel had
been fomenting for many years, and they hoped this would
decide it.</p>

<p>Holding their sides with laughter, the two soldiers watched
while the unequal fight went on—unequal because the weapon
of Ten Eyck, beyond maddening Paul to new exertions,
did no harm. At last, a well-directed blow brought the tall
man to the ground.</p>

<p>As Paul rushed forward, ready, like ancient warriors, to
fight for the body of his conquered foe, the captain held him
back:</p>

<p>“Enough of this. Away to your duty, Paul. Leave him
to us.”</p>

<p>Paul obeyed, and Ten Eyck rose from the ground, a dejected
man—a sadly different one from him who had entered the
corral. He was humbled in the dust. Not only had he been
overreached by his hated foe in the bargain, but he was beaten
in open battle. From this day, he dared not meet Paul Swedlepipe.
The star of Ten Eyck had set forever!</p>

<p>They left the spot, as the captain did not desire to invest in
horse-flesh of that kind. It was in vain that they attempted
to console Ten Eyck. His self-respect was gone; he had been
betrayed, beaten, sold!</p>

<p>“Cheer up, man, cheer up,” said the captain, slapping him
upon the shoulder. “Paul didn’t do it. He never had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
head for it at all. It was all the work of that scoundrel, Boston
Bainbridge.”</p>

<p>“The lightning blast him!” roared Ten Eyck.</p>

<p>“If I catch that fellow,” said Van Curter, “I will keep my
promise to him. I will strap him up to a swaying limb and
give him forty stripes save one.”</p>

<p>“I imagine you will have to catch him first,” answered the
younger man, setting his teeth hard. “I have to thank him
for his interference when I met Barlow in the forest, as well
as for the blow which I think came from his hand last
night. Barlow is not cool enough to knock a man down
who has a sword in his hand. He would have used the
steel.”</p>

<p>“Hot blood, hot blood, like your own. How did you miss
<em>him</em>, last night?”</p>

<p>“It was dark enough, the only light coming from a taper
at the back of my room. No, I do not wonder that I missed
him.”</p>

<p>“Where did you send Carl Anselm?”</p>

<p>“I thought I told you. In my Indian-fighting I made the
friendship of Wampset, a sachem of the Nipmucks. He gave
me a wampum belt, and promised that, if I needed his help,
and would send or bring that belt to him, he would come to
my aid with all the men at his command.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is good; where shall we meet them?”</p>

<p>“At the three hills, near Windsor.”</p>

<p>“It is a good place. You must be satisfied with one of my
horses.”</p>

<p>“It will do. Let us go in.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN OLD FOX AND A YOUNG ONE.</span></h2>

<p>Carl Anselm rode swiftly up the fertile valley, making
the most of the Narragansett pony. He kept well to the west,
away from the post at Windsor, fearing that, if he met any of
Holmes’ men, they might ask awkward questions. The Nipmuck
country proper was further north than Windsor; but
one of their villages, not a stationary one, stood not far away.
This was the village of Wampset, a sort of Indian bandit, who
lived like the gipsys, pitching his wigwams where he chose.
He had fully one hundred men in his village, the bravest and
most restless spirits of his nation. The Pequods, the Romans
of New England, knew and hated Wampset. Many a plan
had been laid to surprise his village; but they had always
failed. The party which came, if stronger than Wampset,
found only warm ashes in the ruined lodges; but the Nipmucks
had flown. Wampset claimed no particular hunting-ground,
but roamed from the most western border of the Pequod
country to the Connecticut, a river he never crossed.</p>

<p>The young German had heard of the whereabouts of
Wampset, from a man of the Nipmuck nation who had come
into Good Hope a few days before. As he approached the
village, he took careful note of every thicket near which he
passed. All at once, the woods seemed alive with signals, and
stealthy footsteps could be heard. Carl knew he was hemmed
in, and was not surprised when an Indian of commanding
presence stood in the path and ordered him to pause. Carl
had been skilled in Indian dialect.</p>

<p>“What would the white man here? He is far from the
strong house of his people.”</p>

<p>Carl took off the belt and held it up before the eyes of the
man. He started a little, and then assumed a calm attitude:</p>

<p>“Let the warrior look upon the belt,” said Carl. “Has he
ever seen it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“He has. Where did the white man get it?”</p>

<p>“From one who sent me to seek the chief, Wampset, that
I might speak a word in his ear.”</p>

<p>The warrior turned and uttered a whoop. It was evidently
an understood signal, for the sound of retiring footsteps could
be heard, and they were alone. The warrior turned again to
Carl:</p>

<p>“Wampset is always to be found by his friends, and by his
enemies when he <em>chooses</em> to be found. Let the young man
speak. Wampset is here.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>The savage laid his hand upon his naked breast, in an impressive
and graceful gesture. Carl could not doubt that he
spoke the truth.</p>

<p>“There is a young war-chief upon the banks of the great
river, to whom the chief gave this belt. Long ago, the Indians
gave the land to his people. But the English people of
Shawmut have come and built a strong house upon the river.
The young war-chief is coming to drive them away, and he
sent the belt to Wampset, that he may come to his aid with
all his men.”</p>

<p>The chief mused:</p>

<p>“I have seen the strong house of the people whom we call
Yengees. They will not go away if they can help it. But,
my word is given to my young brother, and I will go.”</p>

<p>“He said that you must meet him at the three hills, near
the strong house, at midnight to-night.”</p>

<p>“It is well. Let the young man come into the village.”</p>

<p>Carl followed him into the village, which consisted of huts
formed only for summer weather. In winter they had different
habitations.</p>

<p>The chief led the way to his lodge, and invited his guest to
sit upon a pile of skins in one corner. A squaw brought in
two large wooden bowls, with spoons of the same material.
One of the bowls contained boiled venison, and the other
parched corn. Flat, wooden dishes of the same material as
the rest, were placed in their hands, and the two made a hearty
meal, for the young man was tired by his long ride. When
the meal was over, they sat and conversed for an hour. Then
the chief, thinking that the young man looked as though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
needed rest, left the lodge, and Carl lay down upon the skins
and slept.</p>

<p>He rose in about an hour, and went out into the village. He
found the warriors making preparations for a march. The
chief joined him.</p>

<p>“Are not these cabins cold in winter?” asked Carl.</p>

<p>“The Indians do not dwell in such wigwams when the
north wind blows cold,” said the other. “There are pleasant
places high up among the hills, where the Pequods can not
find us, and where we can live until the sun is warm
again.”</p>

<p>“You do not stay in one place long.”</p>

<p>“The knives of the Pequods are long, and their arrows
sharp. They have no love for Wampset. They come upon
his lodges in the night; but, Wampset is not a fool. He
knows when to hide, and when to be found. The sparks are
not out in the lodges when the Pequods come, but the men of
Wampset are gone.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever fight them?”</p>

<p>“When they are not too many. The braves of Wampset
have often sent them howling back to their lodges. But when
we are weak and they are strong, we hide in the bush. Sassacus,
sachem of the Pequods, would give much wampum for
the scalp of Wampset.”</p>

<p>“Does Wampset love the white chiefs at Windsor?”</p>

<p>“Wampset can not love the men who tread upon the graves
of his fathers. The Pequods are my enemies. By day and
night they watch for the camp-fires of Wampset; but they
are brave, and they are <em>Indians</em>. Is the white man owner of
the soil? Did he receive it as an inheritance? No; it is
the land of the Indian. Pequod or Narragansett, Mohawk or
Nipmuck, it is <em>theirs</em>! No, Wampset does not love white
men; but the young chief who saved my life in battle is my
friend. I will aid him, if it is in my power.”</p>

<p>“I must not stay,” said Carl. “There is work before me.
I will go out toward the fort, and you must follow with your
braves. Give me a token by which I may pass your warriors
in safety.”</p>

<p>The chief unclasped a wampum bracelet from his brawny
arm, and fastened it upon that of his young friend. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Nipmuck doesn’t live,” said he, “who would lay a finger upon
the man who wears this. Go in peace.”</p>

<p>Carl rose, took up his rifle and left the lodge. His horse
was tied to a post near the door. He mounted and rode away
toward the east. Wampset looked after him with a half-sigh,
for he saw in him a type of the men before whom his nation
was fading like dew in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Carl pursued his way until he struck the river a few miles
from Windsor. There was something peculiar in the temper
of this young man. He was relentless to his enemies—eager
for their blood; but true as steel to his friends. In his code,
nothing was too much to do for the man who had saved his
life. To risk his own seemed to him a duty which he <em>must</em>
perform. Young as he was, he was a fit tool for such work
as Joseph Van Zandt assigned him. He had fled from the
old country with the blood of a brother on his hands—shed
in a moment of anger. Others had felt his steel, and the
story had never been told. He thought it an easy way to pay
his debt to Joseph, merely by taking the life of William Barlow.</p>

<p>Approaching the trading-post, he paused and considered.
He felt quite certain that he might enter the place without
fear, as there had been no open rupture between the commandants
of the two posts. But he was naturally of a suspicious
disposition, a feeling which is common to such natures
as his.</p>

<p>He finally rode into the place and was kindly received.
He gave them to understand that he had been out upon a
scout at the command of Van Curter, and had been chased
by a part of the band of Wampset. They knew that the
young German was an active scout, and thought nothing of
the story. Willie and Boston Bainbridge had not yet come
in. After finding out all he cared to know, Carl rode away
toward Good Hope, upon the trail usually pursued by travelers.
Once out of sight of the village, he went aside from
the path, took down his rifle and looked at the priming, and
sat down beside the trail, with a look of grim determination
upon his face.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two Englishmen, after their hasty flight from Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Hope, had pressed on as fast as their feet would carry them
toward Windsor. Boston’s knowledge of the proposed assault
caused him many an inward chuckle. He gloried in the
discomfiture of Van Zandt.</p>

<p>“I heard a fall,” said Willie, “while they were pursuing
us from the house. How was that, Bainbridge?”</p>

<p>“That,” replied Bainbridge, with an indescribable twist of
his features, “<em>was</em> caused by the fall of—something.”</p>

<p>“A wise observation. What was it?”</p>

<p>“I would not be certain upon this point, worthy young
man of war,” said Boston. “I can not fight with carnal
weapons. I am a man of peace, and live by trade.”</p>

<p>“Don’t keep up that farce here, I beg you. I have laughed
in secret at the manner in which you have kept this character,
until I am nearly past laughing again. But, what is the use
of keeping it up here?”</p>

<p>“It must be done, Willie. Until Good Hope is ours, and
the Dutch driven out of the valley, I am nothing but Boston
Bainbridge. Do you think any of them suspect, except
Katrine?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Once or twice you have given orders in your usual
tone. Van Zandt heard you to-night, I am sure. Katrine
and Theresa heard you. They are pretty sharp people, and
hard to blind.”</p>

<p>“Katrine is a darling,” said Bainbridge. “I hate to deceive
her. But it must all come right sometime. When she
is my wife we can laugh together over the life of a hawker.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what old Paul Swedlepipe and Ten Eyck are
doing about this time. Won’t the fellow tear when he
sees that horse after the rain? Oh, I would give fifty pounds
to see his face at the time. This rain will wash every grain
of color off from his hide, and we should see a skeleton instead
of the horse I sold him. Never mind; we have a right
to spoil the Egyptians. Ha! The bush moves!”</p>

<p>The sudden exclamation caused Willie, who stood at his
side, to start back in some alarm. The movement saved his
life, for the rifle of Carl Anselm cracked at that moment, and
the ball tore a bloody track through the fleshy part of his
arm. In an instant the bushes parted to the rush of the
body of Bainbridge. For a man of peace, he certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
behaved in a wonderful manner. The movement was so sudden,
that he was close to the side of the would-be assassin
before he could turn. Carl was no coward. His courage had
been proved in a hundred different ways. Drawing his knife,
he made a sudden rush at the hawker, and struck at him viciously
with the keen blade. Boston nimbly eluded the stroke
and returned it by a slashing blow, which laid open the cheek
of the other, marking him for life. As soon as he felt the
wound, Carl turned and fled along the river shore, at his best
speed, with the hawker following like a sleuth-hound on the
trail. He passed round a point of rocks which completely
hid him from view. Bainbridge rushed forward, in time to
catch a glimpse of the German upon the back of his horse,
which he had tied there for security. His jeering laugh
came back to them on the wind.</p>

<p>“He has escaped,” cried Boston, as Willie came up. “He
got to his horse. The devil fly away with him!”</p>

<p>“Is he hurt?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I laid open his cheek from the ear to the chin.
The scoundrel. He will carry my mark to the grave. That
he may, is my fervent prayer. Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“I have never seen him before.”</p>

<p>“I have. He is a minion of Van Zandt, or my name is
not Bainbridge. It is young Carl Anselm. That bullet was
meant for you. How could he miss, when he was not thirty
feet away? The miserable scoundrel belongs in Good Hope.
They say his character is none of the best, even among his
associates. Let me see your arm.”</p>

<p>With some labor and pain, Willie stripped the jacket and
shirt from the wound and showed it to Bainbridge. It was
a deep flesh-wound, and Boston shook his head. Going down
to the river bank, he gathered some leaves from a plant which
grew there. These he bruised into a poultice, with which he
bound the wounded limb.</p>

<p>“I know the nature of the herb,” he said. “An old Indian
woman told me about it, and tried it on a bear-scratch
I once got in a fight with that animal. It was wonderful in
its effects.”</p>

<p>“It feels comfortable,” said Willie, placing the arm in a
sling which the other improvised from a sword-belt. “I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
yet have the pleasure of wringing the man’s neck who did
me this favor.”</p>

<p>“He is no enemy to despise,” replied Boston. “When you
have an open, avowed enemy, you know how to guard against
him; but a sneaking fellow like this, who would shoot you
from behind a bush, is more to be feared. He is full of energy,
and will come upon you in impossible places. In the
assault to-night, look out for <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p>“You think they will come, then?”</p>

<p>“They are not the men to be laggards. I can not understand
what Carl was doing here. He certainly was not sent
out on purpose to shoot you. I could give a reason if I knew
where Wampset was.”</p>

<p>“I know just where he is encamped.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“About twenty miles away. An Indian of the Narragansett
tribe, who came into Windsor the day after you left, told
us where he was. I know that man. He is an outcast from
all tribes, and yet he maintains himself against any force they
can bring against him. He must have a powerful mind.”</p>

<p>“He has. I have seen him once or twice, and he is a
noble Indian. With all his prejudices against the whites, he
has none of the cold-blooded animosity of Sassacus, nor the
supercilious behavior of Mennawan. But this news troubles
me. I doubt not he will come to the aid of the Dutch, for
I have heard it said that Van Zandt once did him a great
service which the Indian will not hesitate to repay, and now
is the Dutchman’s time of want, if ever.”</p>

<p>“Then we have, indeed, much to dread, if Wampset is
brought against us.”</p>

<p>“What Indians were at the post when you came away?”</p>

<p>“Only the young son of the Narragansett chief, the Fox.”</p>

<p>“None better. He is truly named. Let us hasten. Do
you think he will stay in Windsor?”</p>

<p>“He said he would until the full moon.”</p>

<p>“Good. Make haste.”</p>

<p>They hurried into the post. Catching sight of an idler
near the gate, Boston called him, and asked him if the “Fox”
was yet in the post. Being answered in the affirmative, he
desired that he should be sent to him at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Willie turned away, and entered a log-house in one corner
of the stockade, bestowing a smile of recognition upon a
young Indian, who was coming out. The latter made his
way at once to Boston, who greeted him kindly.</p>

<p>“How is the chief, your father?” he asked, touching the
young man upon the naked shoulder with his open palm.
“How long will it be before he will give the tribe into the
hands of his son, who, though he is yet young, has left his
mark upon the enemies of his nation?”</p>

<p>“The chief is very well, and sends his greetings to the
white chief; his warriors hope it will be many years before he
lays down the wampum of a head chief for another to take
up. Who is worthy to take the mantle of Miantonomah?”</p>

<p>“None but his son, when Miantonomah is ready. The young
chief has often said that he only waits to do the white man a
service. Will he do it to-day?”</p>

<p>“When was the Fox unwilling to aid his white brothers?”</p>

<p>“It will take him into the forest.”</p>

<p>“That is well; the forest is his home.”</p>

<p>“He must keep his hatchet keen, for the Pequods may lurk
along the track.”</p>

<p>“A Narragansett does not fear a Pequod.”</p>

<p>“It is well; now let the Fox listen.”</p>

<p>In a few decided words, the Yankee informed the young
man what he wished him to do. Having thoroughly
mastered it and acquiesced in the service, he took his weapons,
tightened his belt, and left the post, taking the trail which
led to the camp of Wampset.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">“THERE’S MANY A SLIP ’TWIXT THE CUP AND THE LIP.”</span></h2>

<p>Van Curter and his men made good time in their march to
Windsor, and at four o’clock in the afternoon they were encamped
behind the three hills. Hardly had they settled themselves
to wait for night, when Carl Anselm came in. His face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
was disfigured by the knife-cut; the blood lay in thick clots
about it, and his small eyes sparkled with vicious fire under
his heavy brows. He made his way at once to the place
where Van Zandt sat, under a large maple tree.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Carl,” said the captain. “In the name of the
saints, what is the matter with your face?”</p>

<p>“I have taken the mark in your service,” replied the other,
angrily. “Come away from the rest and I will tell you
how.”</p>

<p>The captain followed him to a retired spot, then called upon
him to speak.</p>

<p>“I waited in the path for the coming of your enemy until
I became weary and fell asleep; their voices woke me as they
came, and I started up so quickly that the bush stirred. He
was not alone.”</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!”</p>

<p>“No; that cursed spy—for he is nothing better—Bainbridge,
was with him. Sturm and wetter! I will have <em>his</em> heart’s
blood upon my own account.”</p>

<p>“On with your tale, quick. You fired, did you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes. As the bush stirred, Bainbridge called out to his
companion, and he jumped; if he had not done it, a ball
would have been in his heart. My curse upon the meddler.”</p>

<p>“Then he escaped?” demanded the other, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Escaped. Not fully, for my ball struck him on the arm,
and there was blood starting through his clothing. Before I
could look, that devil, whom we call the peddler, was upon
me with an open knife. I had mine in my hand, and made
a blow at him. He is quick as a cat; he dodged the knife,
and struck at me. You see the result. I lay that wound up
against him. I shall do him mischief yet.”</p>

<p>“What did you do then?”</p>

<p>“I saw that he was not what he seemed, and more than a
match for me, I dropped the knife and ran for my horse, I
had tied him in a ravine by the river-side. Curse the Yankee,
he was like a greyhound; if there had been twenty rods more
to run I should be a dead man; but I got to my horse and
was off.”</p>

<p>“It is a total failure, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so. Before, I worked only for you; now I work for
both. I have an account with the man who calls himself
Boston Bainbridge.”</p>

<p>“You might have had before, if you had any eyes. You
love Katrine, the cousin of Theresa.”</p>

<p>The young man turned upon him with a quick look. “Who
told you that?” he said.</p>

<p>“It matters not.”</p>

<p>“Why do you bring her into the conversation?”</p>

<p>“Have you no eyes? Why, man, the other night, while
Barlow stood at the window of my willful maid, whispering
in her ear, whom think you stood at that of Katrine?”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Boston Bainbridge.”</p>

<p>“You know this to be true? It is not a trick to make me
more surely your friend?”</p>

<p>“I saw it myself.”</p>

<p>“Ah.” Carl stopped, and with his knife-blade stabbed the
earth at his feet. “Would that I had him here,” he cried,
“would that I knelt upon his breast as I kneel upon the earth.
He is my enemy until death.”</p>

<p>“You never knew this?”</p>

<p>“I knew that she was proud, and would not listen to
me. I hoped for better things; I thought that a lover’s persistency
would bring about the desired end, and this is the re—result.”</p>

<p>His countenance became as that of a fiend; in the heat of
his passion the blood gushed anew from his wounded face.
He caught some of it in his hand, and cast it from him, crying
passionately:</p>

<p>“Let this blood witness against him.” After that he was
calmer.</p>

<p>“We will work together, my master; much may be done
where there is a good heart in the cause. I am with you, body
and soul.”</p>

<p>“The compact is made. By knife, cord and bullet, I will
be true to you in this business.”</p>

<p>“So let it be,” responded Carl.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Wampset?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Before nightfall he will be here with a hundred men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well done. The English power shall be swept from this
river; our enemies shall be—where?”</p>

<p>“It matters little so that they cumber the earth no more. It
is time Wampset were here.”</p>

<p>“You are sure he will keep his appointment?”</p>

<p>“The promise of an Indian is sure. He will keep his
word.”</p>

<p>“Did you look over the block-house and note the entrances?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There are eighteen men in all, now that this spy
and Barlow are here; the whole is under the command of William
Holmes; his second in command is his brother, who is
away in Boston.”</p>

<p>“His brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of such a man until I came here.”</p>

<p>“Few have; he is seldom seen; people who live in this region
know that there is such a man as Robert Holmes. He
tramps the forest, makes treaties with the Indians, and prepares
the country for the next inroad of Yankees. No man can
put his finger on him and say, ‘This is Robert Holmes,’ and
yet, he is a fixed fact. The people in Windsor have great
faith in him, but are non-committal about him.”</p>

<p>“He is a mystery, then?”</p>

<p>“One which we can not unravel. Some of our people
swear that Robert Holmes is only a name for a devil, who
has taken up his abode at Windsor. I begin to think it is half
right, for who but a devil could exert such an influence over
Yankees?”</p>

<p>“Phew, such talk as that will do for other men than us; as
for this imaginary potentate, if there is such a man, we
probably shall meet him to-night, and try the virtue of cold
steel upon him. I wonder Wampset is not here; he is not a
man to shirk his appointment. Who comes there? Is this the
way they keep guard?”</p>

<p>An Indian, gliding forward like a stealthy ghost, at that
moment appeared before him. At the first look, Van Zandt
knew him; it was one of the men who belonged to the band
of Wampset—his messenger, a light, active fellow, with a cunning
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The first salutation of the captain was sharp and to the
point, “Where is Wampset? It is long since the chief was
known to linger on the war-trail.”</p>

<p>“Wampset has not lingered. But, he can not come to the
aid of his young friend. The Hawk hovers with outspread
wings above his tree-top. Shall not the Eagle guard his own
nest first?”</p>

<p>“What mean you?”</p>

<p>“Sassacus has sent Mennewan upon the war-trail. A dog
who had eaten bread in our lodges told the Pequods that the
Eagle rested his tired wings upon the banks of the great
river. The Pequods are very mad for the scalp of Wampset,
and his band are known in every lodge in the nation. They
are very brave.”</p>

<p>“How do you know this?”</p>

<p>“The band had painted their faces for war and set forth.
Near the river-side they met the Fox. He is the son of Miantonomah,
sachem of the Narragansetts. The Fox is very cunning,
and he loves Wampset. He has sworn to have the scalp of
Sassacus. He told us that he had been in the Pequod
lodges, and they were on the way. They did not know that
he was with them. None are so cunning as the Fox.”</p>

<p>“What did he do then?”</p>

<p>“What could he do? Should he leave his little ones a
prey to the tomahawks of the Pequods?”</p>

<p>This was unanswerable, and Van Zandt could only mutter
curses on the unlucky fate which had worked against him.
If he had only known the truth, <em>fate</em> would not have had the
curses on that day. But, curses would do no good. Wampset
was by this time half way back to his camp, and the Fox,
who had done his work well, was back in Windsor, reporting
to his employer the success of the stratagem. As the reader
has no doubt surmised by this time, the coming of the Pequods
was a coinage of the brain of Boston, who hoped by this
to send the Indians back to their camp. The ruse succeeded
to a charm, and deprived the Dutch of their allies.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to take the place without help,
and Carl, in company with Captain Van Zandt, set out to
reconnoiter the position. It was now growing dark, and they
advanced with caution. All about the stockade was still.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The silence, in fact, was so profound as to be suspicious.
Van Zandt, a practiced Indian-fighter, had his suspicions of
such quiescence. He advanced carefully. There was only
one light in the stockade. That was a fire in the center,
around which sat four or five of the garrison. They were
all stalwart men, for Captain Holmes brought no others into
the wilderness. The spy could see through the chinks that
their arms lay beside them, and ready to take up at a moment’s
notice.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Carl had stolen round to the other side
of the building, and looked through the chinks in the logs.
The cabin in which the officers lived stood close at hand, and
through another orifice in the logs, the young German could
see the interior. There were three men in the cabin—Barlow,
Captain Holmes and Boston. They sat upon stools, by the
side of a wooden table, talking eagerly in low tones. From
the place where he stood, it was impossible for Carl to hear
a word. But, to his astonishment, he saw that Boston not
only took an active part in the conversation, but his opinion
was listened to with great deference. Carl’s blood boiled in
his veins. Since the last night, an intense hatred of the peddler
had grown up in his heart. This was the man who had
stolen the heart of Katrine. He should die.</p>

<p>He drew a pistol from his pocket, and leveled it through
the chinks. The light of a candle upon the table glimmered
along the barrel. He pulled the trigger. The hammer came
down upon the flint without a report. The priming had been
shaken out of the pan in coming from the camp. With a
muttered invective Carl slipped behind the logs of the stockade
and felt for his powder-flask. He had left it in the camp!
The passion of the man was fearful to see. He ran back to
find his captain, and lead him to the spot. The moment his
eye rested upon the group he put a pistol into the hand of
Carl. “Hold,” he said, as that person was about to fire.
“Don’t do it. We must get nearer, and hear what they say.”
The stockade was about twelve feet high, but the corners were
rough, and stood out about six inches from the rest of the
work, forming a sort of ladder. Van Zandt took the lead,
climbed over, and dropped down into the work, between the
wall and the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The conversation continued; but, to the rage of the two
spies, it was now carried on in whispers. It was impossible
to hear a word. Twice Carl raised his pistol, and as often
he was restrained by the hand of his leader, who had no notion
of betraying their presence by a shot, while they were
inside the fort. He feared the men who sat by the fire.</p>

<p>“In God’s name,” whispered Carl, “are you going to let
him escape? I must fire.”</p>

<p>“Who do you speak of?”</p>

<p>“He. That devil, Bainbridge.”</p>

<p>“I have not so much quarrel with him as with Barlow.
Let us get out of this. I tell you you must not, <em>shall</em> not
fire. Come.”</p>

<p>Carl obeyed, sullenly enough. They climbed the wall
without molestation, and reached the other side. All at once
the captain was startled by the report of a pistol, and saw
Carl looking through the crack, with the pistol still smoking
in his hand. A terrible uproar was heard in the cabin.</p>

<p>“Run for it, captain,” shouted Carl. “Missed him,” he
hissed, in his desperation.</p>

<p>They ran in silence until they reached the edge of the
woods, when Van Zandt turned, and took his companion by
the throat. The epithets he exhausted upon him were of the
most fearful nature. Carl shook him off with an angry
gesture.</p>

<p>“Take your hand from my throat, Captain Joseph. You
ought to know, by this time, that the blood of the Anselms
is hot, and can not brook an insult. Hands off, I said!”</p>

<p>“You infernal hound! Did I not order you not to fire?”</p>

<p>“I know it. If I had expected to die the next moment, I
would have fired that pistol. I will have him yet. He is
doomed. Either he or I.”</p>

<p>“Little cares he for such as you are. Fool, do you not
see the immense advantage this man has over you in every
point. He is cool; your blood is like fire. He calculates
every chance; you act upon the first thought which enters
your crazy head. You have, doubtless, by this rash act,
spoiled our chance of taking the stockade. If you have, I
am not the man to shield you from the rage of Van Curter.”</p>

<p>“Take your own course,” replied Carl, angrily. “I care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
not. You had better look to it, or you will cancel the bond
between us.”</p>

<p>This was what Van Zandt did not care to do, and he begun
to conciliate the man. This led him back to the subject of
Bainbridge.</p>

<p>“The unquiet beast stooped for a paper he had dropped
just as I fired. What has happened to me? Is my aim
gone? When was I ever known to miss such shots as
these?”</p>

<p>They hurried back to camp, and put the men in order for the
attack. When they approached a change had taken place in
the aspect of affairs. The works were now brilliantly lighted.
Pitch-pine torches blazed in every crevice; the bright barrels
of guns glistened along the wall. Van Curter halted his men
and came forward, demanding a parley.</p>

<p>“It shall be granted,” cried a voice from within. “Wait.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the door of the stockade swung open,
and two men came out. They were Captain Holmes and
Barlow. Calling Van Zandt to his side, Van Curter advanced
to meet them.</p>

<p>“You have seen me once before,” said Holmes, “and know
I have authority. What has the commandant to say to
me.”</p>

<p>“I am in the service of the Dutch republic. When you
passed up the river, on your way to this place, I warned you
to strike and stay. You refused, and kept on your course!
I was not in a position then to enforce my commands. I
had even made up my mind to tolerate you, as well as I
might. But, since you have been here, the riot and disturbance
caused by your men are beyond the power of my nature
to endure longer.”</p>

<p>“Of what do you complain?”</p>

<p>“You are a cheating set.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“You sell my men horses which are good for nothing.”</p>

<p>“They ought to know better than to buy.”</p>

<p>“But they don’t. Your men make a very bad horse look
beautiful. There is one vagabond among you whom I will
give forty stripes save one, if he ever comes to Good Hope.
I have sworn it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is his name?”</p>

<p>“Boston Bainbridge.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed! What has Boston been doing?”</p>

<p>“Every thing that is bad; nothing that is good. I will
make him wish that he had never been born. He sold a
horse to one of my council for a very high price, bought it
back for five guilders, and sold it to another man for a hundred
and fifty.”</p>

<p>“And you intend to flog him?”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do better than to warn him to keep out of your
way when I see him again. Boston <em>is</em> a cheat in <em>one</em> way.
But to business. You have run out of your course to talk of
him. What are the men of Good Hope doing here?”</p>

<p>“You are on our land. We claim it as the right of our
country, in the name of Hendrick Hudson, the man whom
your country would not honor, and who came to us for his
due. You must break up this trading-house, and take yourself
again to your sloop, get out of the country, and keep
out of it.”</p>

<p>“You are modest in your demands, sir. I will say that for
you. What if I refuse?”</p>

<p>“You see these men?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“They have arms in their hands.”</p>

<p>“I see the arms. They are very rusty. You don’t use
them much, I guess.”</p>

<p>“If you refuse we shall take the place.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you mean you will <em>try</em> to take it.”</p>

<p>“We will <em>take</em> it,” said Van Zandt, speaking for the first
time.</p>

<p>“If you can,” replied Barlow, returning the Dutchman’s
look of hate and defiance.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Willie,” said the captain. “It can do no good.
Now, sir, to your demand. I hold this post in the name and
by the authority of my monarch, king of England. I care
nothing for other powers. My force is not large; but, while
I or any of my officers or men can lift an arm in its defense,
no Dutchman shall enter the block-house, except as a friend.
If he comes as an enemy we will give him English steel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“You speak plainly.”</p>

<p>“I speak as I feel. Twice to-day murder has been attempted
by one of your men. We know him. His name is
Carl Anselm, and he is a servant of Captain Van Zandt.”</p>

<p>“Murder!”</p>

<p>“Nothing else. This morning he fired from a bush and
missed my lieutenant here, or rather wounded him in the arm,
though his intent was to kill.”</p>

<p>“The other?”</p>

<p>“That occurred to-night. The captain and his servant
came down together to reconnoiter. While the captain was
on one side of the building, his servant snapped a pistol at
one of my officers through a chink in the logs. Then they
climbed over the wall at the corner.”</p>

<p>“The devil!” cried Joseph.</p>

<p>“You see we were not altogether uninformed in regard to
your movements, sir. You climbed over the wall and listened
at the chink in the cabin. We whispered, and you could
not hear what we said.”</p>

<p>“<em>Are</em> there devils upon earth?” muttered Joseph, in utter
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Your man still wanted to fire, and you restrained him.
You climbed the wall first, and as your back was turned,
Carl fired the pistol, and missed. Is the account correct?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. And now tell me, if you will do so, how you
know all this?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. You were watched all the time. And since
Mynheer Van Curter has thought proper to speak of one of
my men, and of the punishment he intends to give him, let
me say that I have my eye on this Carl Anselm. If he falls
into my hands he shall not taste a whipping-post, but he shall
have a ride on a higher horse than any he has ever saddled.
And he will find it a tough colt to ride. I shall hang him
as sure as my name is Holmes.”</p>

<p>“You refuse to surrender?”</p>

<p>“Utterly—and I advise you to clear out at once.”</p>

<p>“The consequences must light upon your own head
then.”</p>

<p>“I am ready to abide them. My stockade is strong, and
I have men enough to man it. If you try to take it you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
have to fight. It is useless to prolong this conference. Let
me bid you good-night.”</p>

<p>As they turned to leave, Barlow saw some men creeping
up in the rear, led by Carl. He whispered to the captain.
He turned quickly, when Van Curter laid hands upon
him, and attempted to detain him. Willie found himself in
the grasp of Joseph. With one effort of his prodigious
strength, Holmes dashed Van Curter breathless to the ground,
and turned to the aid of Willie. But, the young men, clinching,
had fallen, and Joseph’s head struck the earth with such
force as to deprive him of his senses. Rising quickly, the
two turned toward the stockade. There were seven men between
them and the gate—unarmed, however, as they had
intended to overpower the officers—not to harm them.
Holmes measured the distance to the gate with his eye, threw
forward his chest, bringing his fists up to his sides. The
Dutchmen gathered in a body to seize them as they started to
run for the gate. As the two men came near they increased
their speed, and came down upon the little group with the
might of giants; using their hands in a manner which astounded
their would-be captors. Carl, who threw himself
directly in Willie’s path, got a “facer” from the one uninjured
arm which sent him down as if struck by a bullet, with a
broken nose. Right and left went the Dutchmen, the dull
thud of the blows sounding ominously of defeat to them.
At last the two men broke through the crowd and reached
the stockade, breathing hard, but not in the least hurt.</p>

<p>“The scoundrels,” said one of the garrison. “Say the
word, captain, and we will go out and whip the entire lot.”</p>

<p>“That word I won’t say. I think too much of my men.
What are they doing, Bailey?”</p>

<p>“Picking up the broken bones and taking them away.
Oh, sir, if you could only have seen the blow the lieutenant
gave the Dutchman who was here this morning!”</p>

<p>“I am glad he got a stroke at him. I will hang that fellow
yet.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Van Curter again, sir,” said one of the men.
“What shall I say to him?”</p>

<p>“Give him a shot. Be careful not to hit him; only give
him a hint to keep out of way or he will get hurt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The man obeyed. Van Curter, seeing the uselessness of
further parley, formed his men in the woods and made ready
for the attack. Holmes threw more wood on the fire, ordered
his men to cheer, which they did with a will, and waited.</p>

<p>“Do you think they will try it,” asked the captain of Barlow.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he replied. “We are ready for them in
any case.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">CUDGELS TO THE FRONT.</span></h2>

<p>Van Curter did not intend to give up without a struggle.
The attempt to take the officers prisoners was made at the instigation
of Captain Van Zandt, who argued that they were
to the garrison at Windsor what the head is to the body, and
that the head once off the body is useless. How poorly they
succeeded has been seen. Still at their posts within the fort,
Holmes knew that they were gathering to attack him. He
passed the word to the men to fight steadily.</p>

<p>Van Curter’s men advanced from four sides, bearing ladders
hastily constructed, with which to scale the walls. Even
now Holmes did not like to use his rifles on them, and called
on them to stay. They only answered by yells of defiance,
and quickened their pace. Holmes reluctantly gave the order
to fire.</p>

<p>The balls whistled about the ears of the Dutch. Several
of them were wounded, but none killed. The injured were
hurried to the rear, and the rest planted their ladders and begun
the ascent. Holmes, who did not like to kill any of
them, ordered his men to throw down the ladders as fast as
they were placed. As there were generally two or three
men on each ladder when they fell, bruises and broken ribs
resulted.</p>

<p>“Cudgels to the front!” cried out a laughing voice at this
juncture.</p>

<p>The men turned. Boston Bainbridge was just coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
out of the cabin, carrying an armful of stout oak cudgels,
which he had been smoothing so as to fit the hand. These
he distributed to the men, who received them with lusty
cheers.</p>

<p>“Throw open the gate,” cried Boston. “We shall show
these knaves that we do not fear them. What do they mean
by coming against us with empty hands. They will bring
guns next time.”</p>

<p>The gates were flung open with a will, and the eighteen
men of the garrison found themselves opposed by about
twenty-five Dutchmen, the rest having been placed <i lang="fr">hors de
combat</i> in various ways. But, they were not the men to yield
tamely, and catching up clubs and stones, they met the sortié
bravely. Foremost among the party from the stockade, Boston
Bainbridge came—not the Boston who sold his wares in
Good Hope, but an active forester, eager for a fray. Carl
Anselm, with his bruised and distorted face, looking fiendlike
under the glare of the fires, rushed at him with a knife in
his hand. But he went down at once like an ox under the
ax of the butcher. The Dutch tried in vain to stand up before
the men of Windsor. They were driven from the field,
and made their way back to camp, dragging their wounded
with them.</p>

<p>Next day they went back to Good Hope. They wanted to
be as far as possible from the long-armed men of Windsor.
With curses both loud and deep, Van Curter led his men home,
closed his gates, and sat down to think.</p>

<p>“Who is Boston Bainbridge?” he asked of Captain Van
Zandt.</p>

<p>“The devil himself,” replied that worthy.</p>

<p>“At least, he is something more than a peddler. Did you
see him fight? Our men went down like grass before the
mower. He has powerful arms.”</p>

<p>“Poor Carl is disfigured for life. First, that blow he took
from Barlow spread his nose all over his face, and now his
head is broken. He will go mad if he does not get revenge.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“The surgeon has him.”</p>

<p>“That was a bad failure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bad! I should think so. But who, I ask you, would
have thought it possible for two men to escape from such a
net? I would have periled my soul on my power to hold
Barlow; but my head struck a stone. That will be settled
sometime. When we meet again with swords in our hands,
one or the other must die. Where is Theresa?”</p>

<p>Van Curter pointed to the door of the next room. The
young man rose, pushed open the door, and entered. Theresa
sat at a table, engaged in some household duty. She looked
up with an odd sort of smile as he entered.</p>

<p>“Have you no welcome for me, Theresa?” he asked, in a
tone of passionate entreaty.</p>

<p>“Would it not be better, Joseph, for us to cease at once at
<em>playing</em> friendship, when I, at least, have not a spark of respect
for you in my heart?”</p>

<p>“When did I become so hateful to you?” he asked, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>“I was afraid of you always; but the time from which I
ceased to hold even respect toward you was when you struck
your hand upon this table, and swore to kill Willie Barlow.”</p>

<p>“You do not remember, Theresa, that those words were
spoken in the heat of passion, aroused by your refusal of me.
Would a man with any heart have said less? Listen to me,
Theresa Van Curter, and mark my words well. You have it
in your power to make for yourself and for me a glorious destiny.
I have influence in the old world. There is nothing I
can not claim in the way of honor and wealth. My love for
you is so entire that you can shape me as you will. My nature
only needs a guiding hand—a loving, tender, womanly hand
like yours. Be my wife. We will turn our backs forever
upon this new country and all its bad associations, and make
a new life in our own fatherland.”</p>

<p>Theresa mused. His appeal had been so impassioned, so
full of heart, that it was not in her nature to hurt his feelings.
He noted her indecision:</p>

<p>“You hesitate, my darling! I have not given you time
enough. You want more. Take it. Weeks, months, a year!
I can wait, only give me some hope, and promise that you will
no longer listen to this plotting Englishman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do not deceive yourself, Joseph,” she said. “It is not in
my power to do as you ask. Spare me any longer speech
upon the subject. It is only just to me that you should
cease.”</p>

<p>“You are hasty; you should take time.”</p>

<p>“This was decided some time since,” she returned, quietly
gathering up some things from the table, and placing them in
a box at her side.</p>

<p>“It then remains for me to tell you what may result, if
you push me too far. Remember, I can bear, and have borne
much for your sake. There is only one way by which you
can save yourself and him.”</p>

<p>“You have no power over him,” she answered, with a curl
of her proud lip. “What may be the way in which we may
be <em>saved</em>?”</p>

<p>“By being my wife.”</p>

<p>“Death before such a redemption! Do you use threats to
me?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I never threaten. I act, as you and your
minion shall find. I bid you good-night, Theresa Van Curter—as
a lover, forever. In after times we may meet again,
and you shall say that I am not a man to be despised. Give
you good-night.”</p>

<p>The door closed behind him, and Theresa was alone. Once
rid of his presence, and the firmness which had sustained her
through the interview gave way; she dropped her head upon
the table, and gave way to a flood of tears.</p>

<p>The night came, dark and gloomy, and Theresa retired
early. The men of Good Hope, tired by their fruitless expedition,
sunk into repose. There was no rain, though the
clouds covered the whole face of the sky. Theresa could not
sleep; she rose, threw on a light wrapper, and sat at the latticed
casement, the place where Willie had so often come.</p>

<p>A dark figure rose outside the window, and a scream rose
to her lips, which was hushed by a low “hist” from the stranger.
She threw open the casement with care. It was
Willie.</p>

<p>“I have not time to exchange a word,” he said, kissing her.
“Whatever happens to-night, keep to your room. Warn
Katrine, also; but be cautious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>With these words he was gone, and she sat in breathless
expectation. An hour dragged by, when, all at once, there
rose upon the still night air the shouts of men in combat.
The Windsor men had turned the tables and attacked Good
Hope!</p>

<p>Cheers and execrations mingled upon the sultry air. Dark
forms flitted to and fro in the gloom. The Windsor men had
followed close upon the trail of the men of Good Hope, and
attacked them at the hour when the senses of all but the
guards were locked in slumber. Indeed, some of the men yet
lingered in the works before the assault came.</p>

<p>In a very short space the outer work was won, and the
Dutch driven into the houses within the works. These they
barricaded, and prepared to make a vigorous resistance.</p>

<p>At the first alarm, Van Zandt and Van Curter were upon
their feet and seized their weapons. In the <i lang="fr">melée</i> outside, they
were separated in some way, and were driven into different
houses. The one in which the captain took refuge was that
of the commandant. Carl was with him.</p>

<p>There were three of these houses in the works, built of logs,
notched and squared at the end. They were solid structures,
capable of resisting a very strong force. About twenty in the
garrison were fit for duty, of whom ten were in one house,
under Van Curter, seven under Van Zandt, while, by a series
of unlucky accidents, Paul Swedlepipe, Ten Eyck and Hans
Drinker were by themselves. As neither of these worthies
would be dictated to by the other, the house was divided
against itself. All the rest of the men were either wounded
or prisoners.</p>

<p>“You look a little out,” said Hans, “unt see if dem Yankees
out dar’, Paul Swedlepipe.” The Dutchmen, as if the
occasion called for it, now talked in English.</p>

<p>“Vat you dink, Hans Drinker? You dells <em>me</em> vas I must
do? No. <em>You</em> go look mit your own eyes, schoost like pung
in a peer barrel.”</p>

<p>“I pe de oldest; I commands dis house,” said Ten Eyck.</p>

<p>“Don’t you vant to puy a <em>horse</em>?” demanded Paul, in a
threatening tone, by way of reminding his adversary of the
battle they had fought in the horse-corral. Ten Eyck subsided
instanter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“I commands dish house,” asserted Drinker, “by orders
mit te commandant.”</p>

<p>“You’s a liar,” said Ten Eyck.</p>

<p>“So he is,” said Paul, “and you’s a pigger liar.”</p>

<p>At this moment a sound was heard like the ripping up
of a bark roof. All three cast their eyes upward.</p>

<p>“Vat’s dat?” asked Ten Eyck.</p>

<p>“You go and see,” replied Paul.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you in—Amsterdam first,” answered the other,
stoutly. “You go, Hans Drinker.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” said Hans. He lighted his pipe, and sat down
to smoke. Paul and Ten Eyck followed his example.</p>

<p>The ripping of boards continued, and something could be
heard dropping upon the floor above.</p>

<p>“Something cooms into dis ’ous’,” quoth Hans, taking his
pipe from his mouth to say it.</p>

<p>“Dink so myself,” rejoined Paul.</p>

<p>“Yaw, den vas shall happen?”</p>

<p>“You go see.”</p>

<p>“Nix—nay—<em>no</em>! You go, Ten Eyck.”</p>

<p>“Nein!” thundered Ten Eyck, puffing away with great
vigor at the long pipe. As he spoke, the doorway was darkened,
and four of the detested Windsor men sprung into the
room. They had mounted the roof, torn off the bark roofing,
and dropped into the garret.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” cried the foremost, as he drew near. “No use
of fighting. Who commands here?”</p>

<p>“Me!” burst simultaneously from three pair of lips.</p>

<p>“All of you, eh? A corporate body, this. Come, boys,
let’s bind these fellows fast and leave them.”</p>

<p>With this benevolent intention he approached Hans Drinker.
When he came near enough, it suddenly occurred to the
Dutchman that it would be no more than his duty to fight a
little. Accordingly, he unexpectedly let go his right fist, taking
the Yankee under the ear. This prowess excited the
others to feats of valor. Paul seized a stool upon which he
had been seated, and hurled it at the head of his adversary.
Ten Eyck grabbed the poker from the wide fireplace, and attacked
his adversary with great zeal.</p>

<p>But fire soon burns out when the fuel is scant. Hans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
conceiving that he had done his duty to the State of Holland,
submitted to be bound, after knocking down his man. This
left four men to two. Paul was overpowered in a moment;
but Ten Eyck retreated to a corner, from which he menaced
all who dared approach with the poker. This at first excited
laughter on the part of the men, but soon turned to anger at
his pertinacity. He stood near the fire and thrust the poker
into the hot coals when it was likely to become cool.</p>

<p>“This Dutchman is too hot,” said one of the men. “Let
us cool him.”</p>

<p>A large tub of dirty water stood in one corner of the room.
Two of the men brought this and placed it in front of the
obdurate Hollander.</p>

<p>“Will you give up?” cried the leader.</p>

<p>“Nein!” replied Ten Eyck. “Never so long as I pe shoost
as I am.”</p>

<p>“Lift her, boys!” was the order. The two men raised
the tub from the floor. “One—two—three—and away!”</p>

<p>The contents of the tub were discharged upon the person of
Ten Eyck, cooling his ardor and poker at the same time. As
he stood there, with the water running in streams from every
angle upon his figure, the men threw themselves upon him,
and tied him neck and heels.</p>

<p>“That job is done,” said the leader. “Now, boys, follow
me, but you, Seth Mather, had better stay with the prisoners.”</p>

<p>One of the men sat down to keep guard, and the rest
passed out into the open space within the works. The rest
of the men stood there, waiting for the issue of the work
upon the first house. The leader reported.</p>

<p>“You have done well,” said Holmes. “Very well, indeed.
Let us hail this house.”</p>

<p>He approached the building in which Van Curter was,
with the strongest party in the works. In answer to his hail,
Van Curter himself came to the window.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” he cried.</p>

<p>“King George and Captain Holmes, of Windsor.”</p>

<p>“To what am I to attribute the honor of this visit?”</p>

<p>“To my ardent desire to return your late courteous visit to
my quarters. It’s a reciprocation of favors. We Yankees
never like to be in debt long for such things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bah! you talk too much, like all Englishmen. Do you
design to take this post?”</p>

<p>“I do. I have now more men than you. Counting the
wounded, those taken prisoners at the first rush, and those in
yonder house, half your force is out of the battle. You have
just seventeen men.”</p>

<p>“You are well informed.”</p>

<p>“I always aim to be so. Do you surrender?”</p>

<p>“Give me an hour to consider?”</p>

<p>“I will give you five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Your demands are hard. What are your terms?”</p>

<p>“You will find them easy. You shall have permission to
march out under your own colors, with your arms and personal
property. We want nothing but the House of Good
Hope.”</p>

<p>“We shall keep our colors?”</p>

<p>“Yes, even to the red color of your noses.”</p>

<p>“And our side-arms?”</p>

<p>“Every thing that is Dutch.”</p>

<p>“In short, all you demand is the surrender of the work itself?”</p>

<p>“Precisely; clear out—that is all.”</p>

<p>“Then I will open the door; your terms are generous, and
I believe are made in good faith.”</p>

<p>“You must submit to be imprisoned in one of the houses
until all your men are in my hands.”</p>

<p>“I will attend to that,” said Van Curter. “Place a guard
upon my men here and come with me.”</p>

<p>The doors were thrown open. The ten men were placed
in a room by themselves and a guard placed over them.
Holmes, Willie and Van Curter now proceeded toward the
other house, and Van Curter called the name of Captain Van
Zandt. He knew the voice and came to the window immediately.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Van Curter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It is I; open.”</p>

<p>“Are the English gone?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then why are you here?”</p>

<p>“I have surrendered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Coward!”</p>

<p>“Be careful, sir! I repeat, I have surrendered the place.
It was useless to resist. The terms are noble. We are to be
allowed to march out with drums and colors, and make our
way to the islands. Our private property is ours. In short,
better terms were never given. Therefore open your doors
and give yourselves up.”</p>

<p>“I never drew a cowardly breath in my life, Van Curter.
This house is my castle; I will keep it against all who
come against it.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I have surrendered,” shouted Van Curter.</p>

<p>“And I tell <em>you</em> that <em>I</em> have <em>not</em>! And, what is more, I
don’t intend to. I have a strong house, and the best of your
men, and the morning is at hand. I will give a good account
of myself, and drive the ragamuffins of Captain Holmes back
to their filthy quarters.”</p>

<p>“You use modest terms,” said Holmes.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha. You are there, Yankee? I give you good-night.”</p>

<p>“You refuse to surrender?”</p>

<p>“Yes; refuse to the bitter end.”</p>

<p>“Then we must make you do it.”</p>

<p>“Do it if you can.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">A NIGHT IN BONDS.</span></h2>

<p>Holmes stepped back and took a survey of the building.
His practiced eye at once took in its strong points. The
doors were of hewn oak, crossed by heavy iron clamps. On
the inside, so Van Curter told them, were heavy bars of seasoned
wood, tough and elastic as so much steel, set into iron
rings upon either side of the door. These bars were four in
number, at equal distances from each other. No common
power could force one of these doors from its fastening.
These entrances were two in number, one at the front and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
one at the back. The windows were seven in number; two
in front, two on each side, and one at the back of the house,
fastened, like the doors, by solid wooden bars. These particulars
they gained from Van Curter, who was angry at the
young captain for refusing to yield. He determined to try
him once more, but found him very obstinate. He then demanded
that his daughter should be permitted to leave the
house. This was refused at once.</p>

<p>“Let me understand you, Joseph. Do you mean to tell
me, seriously, that you intend to keep my daughter in the
house during the attack which will be made upon it?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Then by that act you at once cancel any trust between
us.”</p>

<p>“Let it be as you say. I will make a new bond between
us.”</p>

<p>“Will you let my daughter and her cousin go?”</p>

<p>“No, I will not.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I keep them as a safeguard. They are the tools by which
we will drive these Yankees away from Good Hope. You
will understand it better when you know that there is to be
no childs’-play here—no fighting with cudgels, as we fought
at Windsor. But, with bullet, knife and sword we will make
the house good. Every ball from a rifle which enters this
house will put the life of your daughter in jeopardy. Katrine
also will be in danger, which <em>is</em> a pity, since she is beloved
by worshipful Boston Bainbridge. Where is that
godly youth? He should be here to defend her.”</p>

<p>At these words there was a slight commotion in the rear
of the group, and a man strode forward and addressed the
captain. It was Boston Bainbridge. But, what a change
had taken place in him! His hair, before rugged and unkempt,
was now allowed to fall loose upon his shoulders after
the manner of the cavaliers. He was carefully and richly
dressed; the belt which encircled his waist bore a long sword
and a pair of pistols. His air was defiant, as seen in the
gory light of the coming morning.</p>

<p>“You have called for Boston Bainbridge,” said he, “and
he who hath borne that name for years now stands before you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in his own person, Lieutenant Robert Holmes. What is this
I hear? Does yonder knave dare to make women a target
for his protection? How now, sir; do you claim to be a
<em>man</em>, and yet need a woman for a safeguard?”</p>

<p>“So Boston Bainbridge is dead, and one has arisen who is
of my degree, and we may cross swords with honor. What
care I for what man can say of me? I know my power.
The fair Theresa is in my hands; Katrine is in those of Carl
Anselm. Believe me when I say that they might better be in
the hands of the devil. Draw off your men and leave the
place, or we will do that which will make you and them
wish they had never been born. Away, I say.”</p>

<p>The fearful threat implied in the words of Van Zandt
startled his listeners; there was a quick glance from man to
man, to see if every face looked as ghastly as each felt his
own to be. The girls were in the power of this villain indeed.
How could they be succored?</p>

<p>“Joseph,” said the commandant, in a pleading tone. “Remember
that we have been friends for many years, and that
I have ever listened kindly to your suit. You are jesting now.
You would not harm my child. Throw open your doors and
let us enter.”</p>

<p>“I will not. We will fight while a hope remains, and
when that hope is gone, you shall have your daughter, as she
will be then, not as she is now!”</p>

<p>“God’s curse upon you, villain. Do you not heed a father’s
agony?”</p>

<p>“Not a whit. You have given up the work like a coward,
and I no longer respect you.”</p>

<p>“This shall be answered at the sword’s point,” cried Van
Curter, striking his hand upon his sword-hilt until it rung
loudly in the scabbard.</p>

<p>“As you will. I fight no old man without teeth unless
he forces it upon me. Your young friends there might take
it off your hands.”</p>

<p>“And they shall!” cried Robert Holmes, Boston Bainbridge
no more. “Or my right hand has forgot its cunning.
Hark you, sir; <em>dare</em> you come out and fight me?”</p>

<p>“I hope I am not such a fool. What surety have I that I
should ever see the inside of this house again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“My word.”</p>

<p>“Bah! The word of Boston Bainbridge!”</p>

<p>“Boston Bainbridge is dead. I stand here in his place, a
man of honor and of family, and dare you to the fight.”</p>

<p>“It will not do,” replied the other. “I have the advantage
now, and relinquish it I will not. Go your ways, Lieutenant
Boston Bainbridge Holmes, spy and cheat that you are, and
let us go ours. It will be better.”</p>

<p>The friends drew off and consulted for some time. There
seemed no feasible way of getting into the house, with the
fearful menace of Van Zandt before their eyes. It was fully
concluded to appear to draw off from the house, and by underhand
means to gain an entrance. This was communicated
to the defenders of the house, and every one appeared to
leave the spot. Leaving the window to the care of one of
his men, the Dutch captain turned aside into the little room
in which the girls were confined. They sat upon the bed,
with their arms entwined about each other, weeping, for every
word of the conversation without had come to their ears.</p>

<p>“Go into the next room, Katrine,” said Joseph, “and do
me the favor to keep your ear from the crack. I wish to talk
with Theresa.”</p>

<p>“I shall stay here,” replied Katrine.</p>

<p>“Fool!” was the uncomplimentary rejoinder. “Must I
send for Carl Anselm to drag you out by force?”</p>

<p>“No, no!” pleaded the girl. “Any one but Carl.”</p>

<p>“I should please you if I sent for Bainbridge, only that
worthy is dead.”</p>

<p>“Was it true,” said Katrine, turning her tearful eyes upon
him. “Is he indeed dead? Tell me when and by whose
hand. I heard you say that he was dead. Until then, I
thought it was <em>his</em> voice.”</p>

<p>“He died by his own hand,” was the pitiless reply. “Boston
Bainbridge is no more. The man whose voice you heard
was Lieutenant Robert Holmes. Leave the room.”</p>

<p>Katrine obeyed, passing into the next apartment and closing
the door. She took the precaution to bolt the door upon
the inside, so that Carl, who had uttered fearful threats since
she had been a prisoner, could not enter. He came soon and
rattled at the door, but she would not let him in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next room Joseph and Theresa stood face to face.
There was a settled gloom upon the face of the man. His
fate was following him so close that it appalled him. He begun
to doubt if, after all, he should succeed in his undertaking.
Ho grew desperate, as he looked at the girl, who was wonderfully
calm in his presence.</p>

<p>“Why do you come?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I come to speak for your good, Theresa. I have told you
many times that love for you had taken a deep root in my
heart. Do what you can, be cold or disdainful, the feeling is
the same. You have made me a desperate man. I have
you utterly in my power, you and Katrine. One thing only
will open yonder doors, and set you free.”</p>

<p>“And that thing—”</p>

<p>“Is to take a solemn oath upon this holy sign” (making
the cross on his breast) “that you will never marry another
while I live, and that you will be my wife when I ask it.”</p>

<p>“If you had studied all your life to devise a cruel sentence,
your study could not have brought to life a more wicked one
than this. No, Joseph Van Zandt, you have had my answer.
I have nerved myself to meet death, if it must be, sooner than
be your wife.”</p>

<p>“You must swear it upon the cross,” he rejoined, “lest a
worse fate come to you. Reflect, and tell me if there is not
at least one thing worse than death. Reflect, too, that this
fate shall be yours, and that of the sniveling fool in the next
room, if you refuse. The threat of what I would do has
driven your brave friend away from the house. I have sworn
to do it, and I will keep my word.”</p>

<p>“God will protect me.”</p>

<p>“I am an unbeliever. Your faith can not shake me. Perhaps
He will protect you. Perhaps He will batter down these
strong gates, and let your friend in. It is very probable!
Foolish girl! yield while the way is clear.”</p>

<p>“No, I will not. My friends will attack the house and set
me free. You shall feel what it is to arouse the vengeance
of a true man. Go; you are a coward. The heart of a dog
beats in your breast. You threaten a woman, and make her
love for her friends work against her for your own foul ends.
You never had one true feeling in your heart. What you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
call love for me is only a passion, which would burn itself out
in a twelve-month. Leave me, and do your worst.”</p>

<p>He rushed from the room, closing the door violently behind
him. Carl stood with his face against the wall of the room,
gnawing his nether lip with such energy that the blood started
from beneath his white teeth. The two men saw in each
other’s faces the mirror wherein to read their own hearts.</p>

<p>“I hear strange sounds,” said Carl; “and blood seems to
run before my eyes. If she were to open that door now, I
should kill her. I am getting mad, I think. Was I not
right about that devil upon earth? I will kill him yet, for
he is the cause of all this.”</p>

<p>“You were right enough. He is a brave fellow, in his gay
clothes.”</p>

<p>“To see him now, with his hair curled and his sword at
his thigh! To hear the grand tone in which he speaks!
Will he take her, now that she is in a more lowly station
than he? It would be much to hope that he would slight
her now. Oh, that he would?”</p>

<p>“But he will not. These Puritans have queer ideas of
honor, and would think it a shame to their manhood to break
faith plighted to a woman. I have given your little fool a
bitter pill to swallow. I told her he was dead. She heard
enough of our conversation to hear us say that, and she believes
it. Do these rascals show any signs of a desire to attack
us?”</p>

<p>“I have lost sight of some of them, and can not tell where
they are gone. The rest sit out yonder by the other houses,
eating breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Whom do you miss?”</p>

<p>“Robert Holmes is gone, and so is your friend Barlow.
What if they <em>should</em> set the girls free.”</p>

<p>“The windows are bolted.”</p>

<p>“I know it, on the inside. What is to hinder the girls
from opening them?”</p>

<p>“They are spiked down. I tell you they have not the
strength to open one, even if they could get a signal from the
outside. Did you see those fellows go away?”</p>

<p>“They slipped out of sight, and I think went out of the
gate. After that, I came to this door and tried to get in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“And failed.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is bolted.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think Katrine would do it. I begin to respect
her. What is that, Jan?”</p>

<p>The man who was at the window spoke:</p>

<p>“The truce is over, sir.”</p>

<p>“Are they coming?”</p>

<p>“Yes, captain.”</p>

<p>“Get your guns ready, then. Where is your rifle, Carl?”</p>

<p>“Here, sir.”</p>

<p>“Mark that Barlow.”</p>

<p>“I can not. My bullet has another work to do. When
Robert Holmes is dead it is at your service.”</p>

<p>“Say you so. Well, I do not care. I have no love for
him. These rascals come on slowly. They are well versed
in woodcraft. Something different from the way our blockheads
came up to the stockade at Windsor. Fire whenever
you get a chance, boys.”</p>

<p>The men of Windsor came forward with care, sheltering
themselves as well as they could behind the buildings in the
works. As they came to the last one, they paused and begun
a close fire upon the house. Every head which showed
itself at a loop-hole became the mark of a bullet. One of
Van Zandt’s men was shot through the head before they had
been in action five minutes. The defenders saw that it was
no boys’-play now, and hesitated about approaching the windows.
The captain ordered them all to lie down, knowing
that their fire could do no harm unless the men exposed
themselves. He took his place at one of the loops to watch,
taking care not to give any of the marksmen a shot. But a
lively fire was kept up, and he dared not go away.</p>

<p>“Watch that side, Carl,” he said, pointing to the other
loop. “If they get under the walls we shall have trouble.”</p>

<p>The moment Joseph left the room Theresa was upon
her feet, and the strong bar dropped into its place before the
door. Then, looking into the other room, she called to
Katrine.</p>

<p>“Rouse up, dear,” she said. “Do not lie down like a
child. You have bolted your door—good. When these
dear creatures in the next room come for us we may not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
here. Bring me that stool. We will give them the slip yet.
See if we do not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Theresa,” said Katrine, rising, “<em>he</em> is dead!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it. That fellow can lie, and you know
it. Hold this stool steady so that I shall not fall.”</p>

<p>Katrine obeyed, and Theresa mounted the stool, and took
down a stout saber which hung from a pair of branching
antlers over her head. She lifted the stout weapon, and
looked at it with beaming eyes.</p>

<p>“My grandfather’s sword,” she said. “It has struck good
blows for the honor of his nation. May it do as much for
the honor of his granddaughter.”</p>

<p>Assisted by Katrine, Theresa mounted the wide window-sill,
and strove to pry up the spikes which had been driven
in to close the lattice. But they were strong and resisted her
best efforts. Seeing the uselessness of this attempt, she begun
to cut away the inner fastenings of the lattice bars, and with
the aid of the now active Katrine, at length succeeded with but
little noise, in detaching the ends of these bars. The way of
escape was then gained, since it was hardly five feet from the
ground.</p>

<p>“We are safe,” whispered Theresa. “Let us thank God.”</p>

<p>The two fell upon their knees for a moment, before they
attempted an escape. The shots had begun to fall about the
building. Katrine passed out first, and Theresa followed,
still bearing her grandfather’s sword.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">IT IS FINISHED.</span></h2>

<p>Passing around the house to escape from the rear, the two
girls suddenly came upon two men, whom, in the darkness,
they conceived to be Van Zandt and Carl.</p>

<p>Theresa, in the excitement of the moment, lifted her sword
in her hand and pointed it at the breast of the nearest, who
rushed toward her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stand back,” she cried; “I will not be taken alive.”</p>

<p>“Theresa!”</p>

<p>“Willie!”</p>

<p>The strength which had sustained her until this moment
gave way, and she sunk into the arms of her lover.</p>

<p>“Let us away,” said Willie. “Come, Robert, you are slow.”</p>

<p>Robert Holmes dropped the bar with which he had been
prying open the window, and came forward, saying:</p>

<p>“Our work is taken out of our hands. Katrine, have you
no greeting for me, now that I am no longer Boston Bainbridge,
but Robert Holmes?”</p>

<p>His voice broke the spell; she was in his arms in a moment,
sobbing. “They told me you were dead. I thought I knew
your voice.”</p>

<p>“Let us get out of this, Robert,” said Willie. “You had
better carry Katrine. How much they must have endured.”</p>

<p>“Preserve the sword, Willie,” whispered Theresa, “it has
saved me.”</p>

<p>Keeping in the rear of the house, they stole out of the
postern gate through which they had entered, and soon
placed the girls in safety in the house which was first
taken. This done, the young men went back to their duty.
Van Curter was there.</p>

<p>“Have you succeeded?” he cried, taking his cue from their
happy faces.</p>

<p>“Yes, thank God, the girls are out of that villain’s power,
and we have nothing to restrain us from an attack upon the
house. Give me that white scarf, and I will speak to them.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, Robert,” said his brother; “they are desperate
men, and may not respect the flag.”</p>

<p>“Robert took a ramrod, and fastened the white scarf upon
it. Ordering his men to cease firing, the young man passed
into the parade and called to Van Zandt.</p>

<p>“Why are you here again?” he demanded, angrily.</p>

<p>“To ask you to yield. Why should we shed blood, when
nothing can be gained? Open your doors and let us enter.”</p>

<p>“You ask in vain,” was the stern answer; “you want the
girls, I suppose; but you shall never see the face of Katrine,
and Theresa has bid good-by forever to your friend Barlow.
So away with you if you would save <em>them</em> trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you could look into the room where you placed the
girls, you would see a broken casement and an empty cage.
The girls are safe in our hands.”</p>

<p>“A Yankee horse-trader’s lie.”</p>

<p>“Go and see.”</p>

<p>Van Zandt rushed away and tried the door of Theresa’s
room; it was fast bolted. He soon dashed a hole in it with
the butt of his heavy rifle, and saw the empty cage of which
the other had spoken: the nest was warm, but the birds had
flown.</p>

<p>He went back and whispered to Carl; their conference over,
Van Zandt went again to the window.</p>

<p>“What terms can we make?”</p>

<p>“The terms shall be the same as those given to Van Curter.”</p>

<p>“To all?”</p>

<p>“To every one.”</p>

<p>“I ask no more,” said the Dutch captain. “Go down and
open the door, Jan.”</p>

<p>The doors opened and they passed out, Joseph and Carl
looking back with strange meaning on the shattered window
from which the girls had escaped. The countenance of the
young German, Anselm, pale with contending passions, looked
absolutely hideous under the glare of the rising sun. He had
been foiled at every point; the revenge he had hoped for was
torn from his grasp.</p>

<p>“Bear up, Carl,” whispered the young captain; “do not let
these villains see how you are moved.”</p>

<p>He controlled his feelings by an effort of his powerful will.
“It shall be as you say,” he replied in a hushed tone. “They
shall be aroused only by the blow I shall strike them. Do
your best, so that we shall pass another night in this place.”</p>

<p>“I will set about it,” answered the young captain. “I can
read your thoughts.”</p>

<p>“That is well; then I need not speak. Where are the
girls.”</p>

<p>“In one of the houses, as I think.”</p>

<p>“Do you see that accursed Holmes? He is going to her,
now that he has triumphed over me. Would it not be a pleasant
thing to plunge a knife into his heart? If he gives me
time, I shall do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The two separated, and set about their preparations for departure.
It was found impossible for the former occupants to
leave that day, so they were assigned places outside the fort in
the cabins they had built.</p>

<p>Robert slept in the fort, in the room next to that in which
the maidens were, and from which they had escaped. This
man was always on his guard. He never lay down unarmed.
His slumber was light, and only needed the slightest sound to
break it. At midnight, he was wakened by a sound as if
some fastening was broken. He raised himself upon his elbow
and listened. The sound was continued. It evidently
proceeded from the girls’ room. He rose with care, and, stepping
softly into their apartment, discovered a dark figure—that
of a man—with something gleaming between his closed teeth,
climbing into the window. Robert’s plan was formed in a
moment.</p>

<p>The figure was that of Carl. By slow approaches he advanced
his body, until he stood upon the floor of the chamber.
He now took the knife, which he had held in his teeth,
from his mouth, and approached the bedside.</p>

<p>The girls slept soundly. The perils of the night had wearied
them entirely, and they gave themselves wholly to slumber.
The murderer, for he had no less a thought in his heart,
bent over them. The clear moonlight—for the storm of the
night before had been succeeded by a remarkably bright evening—stole
through the broken lattice, and fell upon the upturned
faces of the two. In his mad desire to be revenged
upon Robert and Willie, Carl could think of nothing which
could wound them deeper than the death of these pure beings.
“They shall die,” he muttered, “and I will never again look
a white man in the face.” The heart of a demon would have
been touched by the beauty of those over whom he lifted his
steel; but the heart of Carl was harder than adamant. The
knife was lifted when a pistol cracked. The murderer, wounded
unto death, dropped the knife and staggered to the window.</p>

<p>“You have triumphed, devil that you are—you have triumphed.
I have nothing left but to die. I curse you with
my latest breath,” he said, recognizing the man who had shot
him.</p>

<p>As he spoke his hold upon the window-sill relaxed, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
fell backward upon the floor. The strong limbs stiffened, and
the moon’s rays fell upon the face of the dead.</p>

<p>Robert quieted the frightened girls, and calling in help, removed
the body. He had, in some way, eluded the guard,
and made an entrance into the works, an unlucky thing for him.</p>

<p>The garrison was permitted, the next morning, to march
away, according to the terms of surrender, with the understanding
that by that surrender they conceded all claims to
the occupancy of the Connecticut Valley.</p>

<p>But, all the captives did not retire. The captives Theresa
and Katrine very wisely preferred to remain at Good Hope,
which fortress Robert Holmes had resolved to retain against
a future need. But, as preliminary to such occupancy, the
minister was put into requisition, and a double marriage was
consummated that morning at which Colonel Van Curter was
present. Though much against his will, he gave the hand of
his child away, bestowing upon her his benediction in good
old Dutch fashion: “If thee will marry an Englishman, he
is the man I shall be content to see thee wed; so God bless
you.” And, the ceremony over, he passed away, heavy-hearted
enough—having lost both fortress and daughter in the unlucky
Good Hope. He soon forgot his sorrows by sailing away to
Holland.</p>

<p>Paul Swedlepipe lived to a good old age, ever retaining an
unconquerable aversion to Ten Eyck. To escape persecution,
this last-named worthy removed further up the Hudson river,
where he became rich and powerful, cursing the Yankees with
his last breath. Wampset kept his band together until his
death, when it was broken up and merged into the Nipmuck
tribe. For years the Dutch settlers missed Boston Bainbridge,
and could hardly bring themselves to believe that the gallant
soldier, of whose fame they heard so much, was the same man
who had supplied them with small goods and poor horses;
nor could they ever understand that his disguise had been assumed
in order to break forever the power of the Dutch in
Connecticut Valley, by gaining information of their designs in
their own houses.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
